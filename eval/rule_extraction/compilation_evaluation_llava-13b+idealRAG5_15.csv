T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or

require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.1.4.1 Accelerator Pedal

b. Pedal Travel is the percent of travel from a fully released position to a fully applied
position. 0% is fully released and 100% is fully applied.
c. The Accelerator Pedal must:
• Return to 0% Pedal Travel when not pushed
• Have a positive stop to prevent any cable, actuation system or sensor from damage
or overstress
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.

T.4.2.2 Two or more electrically separate sensors must be used as APPSs. A single OEM type APPS

T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

b. The Motor shut down must stay active until the APPS signals less than 5% Pedal Travel,
with or without brake operation

command signal is important in all stages.

and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
