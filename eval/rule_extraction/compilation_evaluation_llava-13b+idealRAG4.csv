EV.4.7 APPS / Brake Pedal Plausibility Check
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.3.2.4 (EV only) Additional requirements for Electric Vehicles:
a. The first 90% of the Brake Pedal travel may be used to regenerate energy without
actuating the hydraulic brake system.
b. The remaining Brake Pedal travel must directly actuate the hydraulic brake system.

T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel

configurations require prior approval.

T.1.4.1 Accelerator Pedal
