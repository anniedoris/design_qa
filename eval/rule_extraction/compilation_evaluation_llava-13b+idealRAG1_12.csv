msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
EV.4.7.2 If the two conditions in EV.4.7.1 occur at the same time:
a. Power to the Motor(s) must be immediately and completely shut down
b. The Motor shut down must stay active until the APPS signals less than 5% Pedal Travel,
with or without brake operation

T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
IC.4.5 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
Refer to T.4.2 for specific requirements of the APPS
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.

data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.3.2.4 (EV only) Additional requirements for Electric Vehicles:

treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above

a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
EV.4.7.1 Must monitor for the two conditions:
• The mechanical brakes are engaged EV.4.6, T.3.2.4
• The APPS signals more than 25% Pedal Travel EV.4.5
