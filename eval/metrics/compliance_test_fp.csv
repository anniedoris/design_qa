"Explanation: Based on rule F.3.5.3b from the rule document, aluminum tubing used for structures such as the battery structure must have a minimum wall thickness of 2.0 mm when welded. However, for non-welded aluminum tubing, the rule does not specify a minimum wall thickness. The image provided shows the results of an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure, which is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The simulation results indicate the stress distribution across the structure under a given load, but they do not provide information about the wall thickness of the tubing used.

To determine if the battery structure can be used in the vehicle, we would need to ensure that the actual wall thickness of the non-welded aluminum tubing meets any specific requirements set forth by the competition rules for non-welded applications, as well as any additional structural integrity criteria that may be applicable to ensure safety and performance. Since the provided rule excerpt and image do not give information about the wall thickness or any other specific non-welded tubing requirements, we cannot conclusively determine the compliance of the battery structure based solely on the provided information.

"Explanation: The image shows an FEA simulation of an assembly of frame tubes, which are color-coded based on the stress levels experienced by different sections of the assembly. The color scale indicates that the stress values range from 0 MPa to 150 MPa. According to rule F.3.4.2b from the rule document, the welded properties for steel tubing used in calculations must have a minimum yield strength (Sy) of 180 MPa and a minimum ultimate strength (Su) of 300 MPa. The FEA simulation results must be compared to these values to determine if the assembly is structurally sound for use in the vehicle. If the maximum stress in the assembly during the simulation is below the yield strength of 180 MPa, then the assembly has not yielded and can be considered safe for use. However, if the maximum stress exceeds this value, the assembly may not be safe as it could experience plastic deformation or failure.

Answer: Without specific numerical values for the stress at critical points in the assembly, it is not possible to give a definitive yes or no answer. The decision would depend on whether the maximum stress in any part of the assembly exceeds the yield strength of 180 MPa as per the rule. If the maximum stress is below 180 MPa, then yes, the assembly can be used. If it exceeds 180 MPa, then no, the assembly should not be used.",yes,The image shows the dimension of the cars wheelbase and it is clearly less than the rules minimum wheelbase.
