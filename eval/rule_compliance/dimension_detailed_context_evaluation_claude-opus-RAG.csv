Explanation: The engineering drawing shows the overall length (166.1 mm), width (R203.2 mm) and some height dimensions of the vehicle. However, it does not explicitly specify the diameter of the front and rear tires, nor the distances 75 mm in front of and behind the outer tire diameters to define the keep out zones per V.1.1.c. Without those key dimensions called out, I do not have enough information to assess if any part of the vehicle structure enters the keep out zones when viewed from the side elevation with the wheels pointed straight ahead.

Explanation: Rule V.1.1.c states that no part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of the outer diameter of the front and rear tires in the side view, with tires steered straight ahead. The engineering drawing shows the wheelbase is 1600.3 mm and the track width is 1200.3 mm. However, it does not explicitly dimension the position of the tires relative to the front and rear of the chassis. Without knowing how far the tires are inset from the extreme ends of the vehicle, it's not possible to determine if any parts infringe on the 75 mm keep out zones. The other views and information also do not specify this. More dimensions would be needed to conclusively assess compliance.

More dimensions would be needed to say for certain.

Answer: No, based on the limited dimensions provided, the design does not appear to comply with rule F.6.4.4b, as the lower side impact member seems to be positioned too low relative to the floor of the chassis to allow sufficient space to meet the ""no lower than 350 mm below the top of the side impact structure"" requirement.

The drawing shows a thickness of only 2.56mm.,"Explanation: According to rule T.5.2.7a in the FSAE rule document, scatter shields for chain drives must be made of steel with a minimum thickness of 2.66 mm (0.105 inch). The engineering drawing shows that the scattershield has a thickness of 2.56 mm. Since 2.56 mm is less than the required minimum thickness of 2.66 mm, the design does not comply with rule T.5.2.7a based on the dimension explicitly provided in the drawing.

No alternative materials are allowed.

Using the scale bar provided in the engineering drawing, which indicates a length of 1200.9 mm, I can determine the thickness of the scatter shield. The thickness dimension is clearly labeled as 3.00, meaning the steel scatter shield is 3.00 mm thick.

Since the scatter shield is made of steel and has a thickness of 3.00 mm, which exceeds the minimum required thickness of 2.66 mm specified in rule T.5.2.7a, the design complies with this rule.

Rule T.7.6.1 states that when forward of the centerline of the front wheel axles, any part of any aerodynamic device must be ""Inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the outside of the front tires at the height of the hubs."" The drawing does not explicitly show the lateral position of the aerodynamic device relative to vertical planes touching the outside of the front tires. Without that dimension specified, I cannot definitively determine if the aerodynamic device complies with the width restriction in T.7.6.1. More information would be needed about the device's position relative to the outer planes of the front tires.

Answer: Unable to determine based on the dimensions provided in the engineering drawing."

Using the scale bar, the overall vehicle width is approximately 1600 mm. The front track width, measured at the outside of the front tires, appears to be around 1200-1250 mm.

The front wing aerodynamic devices extend to nearly the full vehicle width of 1600 mm, which is wider than the allowed planes defined by the ~1200 mm front track width. Therefore, the aerodynamic devices extend outboard of the allowed vertical planes and do not comply with the rule.

Answer: No, the aerodynamic devices shown do not comply with FSAE rule T.7.6.1, as they extend outboard of the maximum allowed width planes based on the front track width."

Since the engineering drawing does not explicitly show the location of the Head Restraint Plane, and the aerodynamic device only extends 23.79 mm behind the rear tires which is less than the 250 mm maximum allowed by rule T.7.5, we can assume the aerodynamic device is in compliance with T.7.6.3 referring to the Rear Aerodynamic Zone defined in T.7.3.3.

Rule T.7.6.3 states that when rearward of the centerline of the rear wheel axles, any aerodynamic device must be in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone, which is defined in T.7.3.3 as rearward of the Head Restraint Plane. The Head Restraint Plane is a vertical plane at the rearmost portion of the driver's head restraint.

Without knowing the exact position of the rear axle centerline or Head Restraint Plane, it's difficult to definitively determine compliance. However, given the overall length of 4000.3 mm, it seems unlikely the aerodynamic device would fit entirely in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone if the rear axle is near the midpoint of the wheelbase. More specific dimensions would be needed relative to the rear axle and head restraint to make a conclusive assessment.

Answer: Cannot be determined conclusively based on the information provided in the engineering drawing. More specific dimensions are needed."

The engineering drawing shows the side view of the vehicle. Using the provided scale, the height of the rearmost aerodynamic device (rear wing) appears to be approximately 1150 mm above ground. This is determined by measuring the vertical distance from the bottom of the wheel to the top of the rear wing and scaling it based on the provided scale bar.
