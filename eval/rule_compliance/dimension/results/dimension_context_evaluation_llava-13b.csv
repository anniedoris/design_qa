To determine if the design complies with rule V.1.2, we need to measure the distance between the driver's head and hands when seated in the normal driving position. The rule requires that the driver must have a minimum field of vision of 100Â° to both sides and that the driver's head and hands must not contact the ground in any rollover attitude.

The engineering drawing shows the dimensions of the cockpit and the driver's position. To calculate the field of vision, we need to know the distance between the driver's eyes and the center of the steering wheel. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the engineering drawing. However, we can determine if the driver's head and hands will not contact the ground in any rollover attitude by checking the height of the cockpit and the position of the driver's hands on the steering wheel.

To determine if our design complies with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document, we need to examine the dimensions of the vehicle as shown in the engineering drawing. Rule V.1.2 states that the vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm.

The engineering drawing shows the dimensions of the vehicle, but it does not explicitly show the wheelbase. However, we can infer that the wheelbase is at least 1525 mm based on the minimum requirement stated in the rule. Therefore, we can conclude that our design complies with rule V.1.2.

To determine if our design complies with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing with the minimum dimensions required by the rule.

According to rule V.1.2, the vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm. In the engineering drawing, the wheelbase can be measured as 1525 mm, which means our design complies with this rule.

Next, we need to check if the smaller track of the vehicle (front or rear) is at least 75% of the larger track. In the drawing, the front track is 1000 mm and the rear track is 1200 mm. To calculate the smaller track, we need to find the average of these two tracks. (1000 + 1200) / 2 = 1100 mm. Therefore, the smaller track is 75% of the larger track, which means our design complies with this rule as well.

To determine if the design complies with rule F.5.9.5, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle's wheelbase, track, and overall length with the specified minimum and maximum values in the rule. We have the engineering drawing and six CAD views of the vehicle, which provide us with the necessary dimensions.

First, we need to identify the dimensions of the wheelbase, track, and overall length from the engineering drawing and CAD views. Next, we compare these dimensions with the minimum and maximum values specified in rule F.5.9.5. If the dimensions of the vehicle meet or exceed the minimum and maximum values, the design complies with the rule.

To determine if the design complies with rule F.6.3.4, we need to calculate the minimum distance between the centerline of the chassis and the front and rear axle centerlines. The image provides the dimensions in millimeters and the engineering drawing shows the vehicle's orientation.

To calculate the distance, we need to find the centerline of the chassis and the front and rear axle centerlines. The centerline of the chassis can be found by connecting the two most central points of the chassis. The front and rear axle centerlines can be found by connecting the center of the front and rear wheels, respectively.

Once we have these centerlines, we can measure the distance between the chassis centerline and the front and rear axle centerlines. If this distance is greater than or equal to 250 mm above the ground, the design complies with rule F.6.3.4.

To determine if the design complies with rule F.3.2.1g, we need to compare the dimensions of the main hoop with the minimum size requirements given in the rule. In the engineering drawing, the main hoop is a steel tube with dimensions (height) x (outer diameter) = 300 mm x 35 mm.

The rule F.3.2.1g states that the main hoop must be a single piece of uncut, continuous, closed section steel tubing meeting F.3.2.1.g. F.3.2.1.g does not provide any specific size requirements, but it refers to F.3.4.1. Since the main hoop in the image is a single piece of uncut, continuous, closed section steel tubing, we can conclude that it meets the requirements of F.3.2.1.g.

The drawing shows the lowest point of the upper side impact member is only 231.56mm above the low side impact member.,"Explanation:
To determine whether the design complies with rule F.6.4.4b, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing with the specified minimum dimensions for the wheelbase, track, and center of gravity. In the image, we can see that the wheelbase is 1525 mm, which is greater than the minimum required length of 1500 mm. However, we need to examine the track and center of gravity dimensions as well.

The track dimensions in the engineering drawing are not explicitly shown. To determine the track dimensions, we would need to measure the distance between the outer edges of the two front wheels and the two rear wheels. If the track dimensions are greater than or equal to 75% of the larger track, the vehicle would comply with rule F.6.4.4b.

The center of gravity dimensions are also not explicitly shown in the engineering drawing. To determine the center of gravity dimensions, we would need to measure the distance between the front and rear axles and compare it to the minimum center of gravity dimensions specified in the rule. If the center of gravity dimensions are within the specified limits, the vehicle would comply with rule F.6.4.4b.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,T.5.2.7cc.jpg,scale,,"Explanation:
To determine whether the design complies with rule T.5.2.7c, we need to calculate the minimum width of the scatter shield based on the chain's width and compare it to the width of the scatter shield in the engineering drawing. The drawing shows that the chain is centered on the gears, which means the width of the chain is equal to the distance between the two gears. Since the drawing is in millimeters, we can calculate the width of the chain by measuring the distance between the two gears.

The minimum width of the scatter shield, as per rule T.5.2.7c, is equal to three times the width of the chain. To calculate this, we need to first determine the width of the chain in millimeters.

Answer:
Based on the image and the rule T.5.2.7c, it appears that the design does not comply with the requirement. The width of the scatter shield in the drawing is less than three times the width of the chain."

Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3) specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3)c.jpg,scale,,"Explanation:
To determine whether the design complies with rule T.7.6.3, we need to check if the distance between the two vertical planes on each side of the vehicle is at least 400 mm outboard from the centerline. In the engineering drawing, the two vertical planes on each side of the vehicle are shown as lines that are 400 mm outboard from the centerline. Therefore, the design complies with rule T.7.6.3.

To determine whether our design complies with rule T.7.7.1a, we need to compare the height of the bodywork in the engineering drawing to the height restrictions specified in the rule. The rule states that any part of the bodywork located in the rear aerodynamic zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing shows that the highest point of the bodywork is at 1320 mm, which is higher than the allowed limit. Therefore, our design does not comply with rule T.7.7.1a.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,T.7.7.1ac.jpg,scale,,"Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a, we need to calculate the height of the vehicle's bodywork. The height is defined as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest point of the bodywork. In the engineering drawing, the highest point of the bodywork is the top of the car. The scale bar on the drawing shows a unit of 100 mm, which means that 100 mm on the drawing corresponds to 100 mm in reality. Therefore, to find the height of the bodywork, we need to measure the vertical distance from the ground to the top of the car in the engineering drawing.

Answer:
Yes."
