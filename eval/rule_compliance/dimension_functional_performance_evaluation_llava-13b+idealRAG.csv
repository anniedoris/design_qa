Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
The image shows the results of an FEA simulation for a battery structure made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The simulation includes a stress analysis, and the maximum stress value is located in the middle of the structure.

To determine if the battery structure can be used in the vehicle, we need to compare the maximum stress value to the yield strength and ultimate strength requirements for aluminum tubing as specified in the rule document. If the maximum stress value is below the yield strength, the structure should be able to withstand the required load without failure. However, if the maximum stress value is above the ultimate strength, the structure might not be able to withstand the required load, and it would be necessary to redesign the structure to meet the strength requirements.

Answer:
Based on the provided image and the rule document, it is not possible to definitively determine if the battery structure can be used in the vehicle without more information."
