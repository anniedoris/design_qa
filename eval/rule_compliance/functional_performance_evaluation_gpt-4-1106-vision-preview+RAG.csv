"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,1.png,We should use the battery structure in the vehicle because the stress result in the FEA model is less than the yield strength of non-welded 6061-T6 tubing (240 Mpa).,"No.

Explanation: The image provided shows an FEA simulation of a battery structure, but without specific values for stress levels, it is not possible to confirm compliance with the rules. According to rule F.3.5.3b, non-welded aluminum tubing must have a minimum wall thickness of 2.0 mm and must meet certain material property requirements. The rule specifies that for aluminum alloy 6061-T6, the yield strength must be at least 240 MPa and the ultimate strength must be at least 290 MPa. The image does not provide enough information to determine if the maximum stress in the structure exceeds the yield strength of the material. Therefore, without additional data confirming that the stresses are within the allowable limits and that the wall thickness meets the minimum requirement, it cannot be confirmed that the battery structure is compliant with the rules and can be used in the vehicle."

Explanation: The image provided shows an FEA simulation of a battery structure made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. However, without specific values for stress and how they compare to the yield strength (240 MPa) and ultimate strength (290 MPa) of 6061-T6 aluminum as specified in rule F.3.5.3b, it is not possible to determine compliance with the rules from the image alone. The rule requires that the material properties be established at a temperature of 60 °C, and the SES must contain calculations that show equivalence to or better than the minimum requirements for steel tubing in the application. Since the image does not provide this information, we cannot confirm that the battery structure meets the necessary requirements for use in the vehicle."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows information about the riders that can be accommodated in the vehicle. At the top of the image, there is general anthropomorphic information. Below that, there is information about the largest man and smallest woman our vehicle can accommodate. Based on the information presented in the image, does our vehicle comply with rule V.2.1.1 presented in the rule document? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,3.png,"V.2.1.1 states that the vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from 5th percentile female
up to 95th percentile male. Based on the data presented, we can see that the data for the largest man and smallest woman that the vehicle can accommodate match the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male anthropomorphic data. Therefore, the vehicle complies with V.2.1.1.","No.

Explanation: Rule V.2.1.1 states that the vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from the 5th percentile female to the 95th percentile male. The image provided shows the dimensions for the smallest woman and the largest man that can be accommodated in the vehicle. However, the dimensions for the largest man do not meet the 95th percentile male dimensions as specified in the general anthropometric data at the top of the image. For example, the Stature Height for the 95th percentile male is listed as 1895 mm, but the largest man that can be accommodated has a Stature Height of only 1865 mm. Similarly, discrepancies can be seen in other dimensions such as Sitting Height and Sitting Shoulder Height. Therefore, based on the information presented in the image, the vehicle does not comply with rule V.2.1.1."

Explanation: Rule V.2.1.1 states that the vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male. The image provided shows the smallest woman who can be accommodated has a stature height of 740 mm and the largest man has a stature height of 905 mm. However, the general anthropometric data at the top of the image indicates that the 5th percentile female has a stature height of 1515 mm and the 95th percentile male has a stature height of 1880 mm. Since the stature heights of the smallest woman and largest man that can be accommodated in the vehicle do not cover the range specified in the rule, the vehicle does not comply with rule V.2.1.1."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current. Based on this image and rule EV.5.8.4 in the rule document, can we use the resistor for TSMP? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,5.png,"EV.5.8.4a states that accumulator max voltage between 200 and 400 volts requires a 10kOhm resistor. The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","No.

Explanation: According to the rules stated in the FSAE rule document, specifically rule EV.5.8.4, the resistor value for the TSMPs is determined by the maximum TS voltage (Vmax). The image provided shows the calculated TS voltage over time, and it appears to reach a value of approximately 400 V. Referring to the rule EV.5.8.4, for a Vmax greater than 200 V DC but less than or equal to 400 V DC, a 10 kOhm resistor is specified. Since the calculated TS voltage does not exceed 400 V, a 10 kOhm resistor is appropriate for use with the TSMPs."

The image shows the max voltage is in this 400 to 600 range, so a 15kOhm resistor (and not an 10 kOhm resistor) is needed.","No.

Explanation: According to the rules provided, specifically rule EV.5.8.4, the value of the resistor used for the Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP) depends on the maximum Tractive System Voltage (Vmax). The image provided shows that the calculated Tractive System voltage over time approaches 600 V. Based on the rules, for a maximum voltage greater than 400 V DC and up to 600 V DC, a 15 kOhm resistor is required. Since the voltage approaches 600 V, a 10 kOhm resistor would not be appropriate, and instead, a 15 kOhm resistor should be used to comply with the rules."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator obtained from experiments. Assuming the impact attenuator is a standard honeycomb type, and based on this image and rule F.8.7.2 in the rule document, can we use the impact attenuator in the vehicle?

The force-displacement curve shows that the peak load is less than 60 kN, so this impact attenuator can be used.","No.

Explanation: According to rule F.8.7.2 from the FSAE rule document, the peak load for a Standard Honeycomb Impact Attenuator should be 60 kN. The force-displacement curve provided in the image shows that the peak force does not exceed 50 kN. Since the peak force of the impact attenuator does not meet the minimum requirement of 60 kN as specified in the rules, this impact attenuator cannot be used in the vehicle for the competition."

Explanation: According to rule F.8.7.2 from the FSAE rule document, the peak load for a standard honeycomb impact attenuator should be 60 kN. The force-displacement curve provided in the image shows that the peak force exceeds 60 kN, which does not comply with the specified requirement. Therefore, based on the provided data and the rules, this impact attenuator cannot be used in the vehicle."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on an assembly of frame tubes. The frame tubes are made from welded steel tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.4.2b in the rule document, should we use the assembly in the vehicle? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",no,9.png,"F.3.4.2b states that the yield strength of welded steel is 180 MPa. The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 250 MPa, which exceeds the yield strength. Therefore this assembly should not be used.","No.

Explanation: The image provided shows an FEA simulation with a color scale indicating stress levels in megapascals (MPa). The color scale goes up to 250 MPa, and there are regions in the assembly that appear to be in the higher range of the scale, potentially close to or above the yield strength for welded steel tubing as specified in the rules (Yield Strength (Sy) = 180 MPa). According to rule F.3.4.2b, the yield strength for welded steel is 180 MPa, and if the simulation indicates that the stress in the assembly exceeds this value, it would not be safe to use in the vehicle as it may fail under the given loads. The assembly would need to be redesigned to ensure that the stresses do not exceed the material's yield strength to comply with the rules and ensure safety."

The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 150 MPa, which is less than the yield strength. This assembly can be used.","No.

Explanation: The image provided shows an FEA simulation with a color-coded stress distribution on a frame assembly. However, without specific values of stress, material properties, or the loading conditions used in the simulation, it is not possible to determine compliance with rule F.3.4.2b from the FSAE rule document. This rule specifies the required properties for welded steel materials, including yield strength (Sy) and ultimate strength (Su). To ensure the assembly is suitable for use in the vehicle, the simulation results must demonstrate that the stresses in the welded areas do not exceed the allowable stresses defined by the rule. Since the image does not provide this information, we cannot confirm that the assembly meets the requirements solely based on the visual output of the FEA simulation."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculation of the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. Based on rule T.3.2.2 in the rule document, did we use correct inputs in our analysis? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,11.png,The input force on the brakes is over the 2000 N required in the rules.,"No.

Explanation: Rule T.3.2.2 from the FSAE rules document states that the brake pedal and associated components must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure. In the image provided, the force input for the brake pedal analysis is shown as 3500 N, which is higher than the minimum requirement specified in the rule. Therefore, the inputs used in the analysis exceed the minimum force requirement stated in the rule, which means the analysis is conservative in terms of the force applied. However, it is important to note that while the force used in the analysis is higher than the minimum required, this does not necessarily mean the analysis is incorrect; it simply means that the pedal is being tested for a higher load than the minimum specified by the rules. If the intention was to test according to the exact specifications of the rule, then the input force should be 2000 N."

Explanation: Rule T.3.2.2 states that the brake pedal and associated components must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure. The force applied in the analysis image is shown as 1335.05 N, which is less than the required 2000 N. Therefore, the inputs used for the analysis do not meet the minimum force requirement specified in the rule."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image the results from an experiment where the temperature of gearbox components was measured over time. Based on rule T.1.6.1 in the rule document and assuming that the driver may come in contact with the gearbox, can we omit insulation around the gearbox?  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,13.png,"Rule T.1.6.1 states that sufficient heat insulation must be provided to ensure that the driver will not contact any metal or other materials which may become heated to a surface temperature above 60 degrees C. The image shows that the gearbox temperature does not surpass 60 degrees C, so insulation can be omitted.","No.

Explanation: According to rule T.1.6.1, sufficient heat insulation must be provided to ensure that the driver will not contact any metal or other materials which may become heated to a surface temperature above 60°C. The image shows that the temperature of the gearbox components, specifically the ring gear and housing, exceeds 60°C over time. Therefore, insulation around the gearbox is required to prevent the driver from coming into contact with surfaces that exceed the specified temperature limit."

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the mount that connects a motor to the structural frame. The frame is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, should we use the motor mount in the vehicle?  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,15.png,The stress on the frame does not exceed the yield stress of 240 Mpa.,"No.

Explanation: The FEA simulation image shows stress concentrations in the motor mount, with some areas approaching the yield strength of 6061-T6 aluminum, which is 240 MPa according to rule F.3.5.3b. The areas in red are close to or exceed this value, indicating that the motor mount may not have sufficient strength and could fail under load. The design should be revised to reduce stress concentrations and ensure that all parts of the mount are well within the material's yield strength for safe operation."

Explanation: The image provided shows an FEA simulation with a color scale indicating stress levels in megapascals (MPa). The highest stress shown in the image is 362.13 MPa. According to rule F.3.5.3b from the FSAE rule document, the minimum yield strength for non-welded aluminum alloy 6061-T6 is 240 MPa. Since the maximum stress in the motor mount exceeds the yield strength of the material, the mount is likely to experience plastic deformation and potentially fail under the simulated load conditions. Therefore, it should not be used in the vehicle without redesigning to reduce the stress below the yield strength or using a material with a higher yield strength."
