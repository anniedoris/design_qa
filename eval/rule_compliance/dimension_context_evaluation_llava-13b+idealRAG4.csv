Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule V.1.2, we need to calculate the minimum wheelbase of the vehicle based on the engineering drawing. The wheelbase is the distance between the two front wheels and can be found by measuring the distance between the center of each wheel.

First, we need to identify the center of each wheel. Since the vehicle has two front wheels, we can measure the distance from the center of one wheel to the center of the other wheel. Let's call this distance ""d"". We can then calculate the wheelbase by multiplying ""d"" by 2, as there are two wheels.

Next, we need to compare the calculated wheelbase with the minimum wheelbase specified in rule V.1.2. If our design's wheelbase is greater than or equal to the minimum wheelbase, then our design complies with rule V.1.2.

No"

The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule V.4.1 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:

To determine if the design complies with rule V.4.1, we need to measure the wheel diameter in the engineering drawing using the scale bar provided. The wheel diameter should be at least 203.2 mm (8 inches). We can measure the wheel diameter by taking the length of the wheel, including the hub, and dividing it by the number of wheel spokes or segments.

To determine if our design complies with rule V.1.4.2 specified in the FSAE rule document, we need to compute the minimum ground clearance of our vehicle. The rule states that the minimum ground clearance must be 75 mm or less. The engineering drawing provides a scale bar, which we can use to measure the dimensions in the drawing.

We can start by measuring the distance between the ground and the lowest point of the vehicle on the horizontal plane. Since the scale bar is not directly applicable to the vertical axis, we'll need to find a point on the vehicle that is parallel to the ground. In this case, we can use the bottom of the chassis as a reference point.

By measuring the distance from the ground to the bottom of the chassis, we can calculate the ground clearance. If this distance is 75 mm or less, then our design complies with rule V.1.4.2.

Rule F.5.7.5 states that the distance from the rearmost face of the steering wheel to the front of the vehicle must be no more than 250 mm. To measure this distance, we need to determine the dimensions of the steering wheel and the front of the vehicle in the engineering drawing.

First, we need to identify the steering wheel in the drawing. We can do this by looking for the shape and size of the wheel that is commonly associated with a steering wheel. Once we have identified the steering wheel, we can measure its diameter and thickness.

Next, we need to determine the front of the vehicle. This can be done by looking for the point where the vehicle's nose or front end is located. We can then measure the distance from this point to the rearmost face of the steering wheel.

If the distance between the front of the vehicle and the steering wheel is no more than 250 mm, then our design complies with rule F.5.7.5. If it is greater than 250 mm, then our design does not comply with the rule.

To determine if the design complies with rule F.5.7.5, we need to measure the distance horizontally, on the vehicle centerline, from the rear surface of the Front Hoop to the forward most surface of the steering wheel rim with the steering in the straight ahead position. In the engineering drawing, the distance between these two points is 170 mm. Since the rule states that the Front Hoop must be no more than 250 mm forward of the steering wheel, our design complies with the rule.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule F.5.7.6 in the FSAE rule document, we need to evaluate the inclination of the Front Hoop above the Upper Side Impact Structure. In the engineering drawing, the Front Hoop is shown to be inclined at 32 degrees from the vertical. Rule F.5.7.6 states that the part of the Front Hoop above the Upper Side Impact Member attachment must be inclined less than 20 degrees from vertical. Since the inclination of the Front Hoop in the engineering drawing is 32 degrees, which is greater than 20 degrees, our design does not comply with rule F.5.7.6.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.5.9.4 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:

To determine if the design complies with rule F.5.9.4, we need to compare the dimensions of the Main Hoop and its Braces to the specified requirements in the FSAE rule document. The rule states that the Main Hoop must be supported by two Braces extending in the forward or rearward direction, one on each of the left and right sides of the Main Hoop. Additionally, the Main Hoop and the Main Hoop Braces must not lie on the same side of the vertical line through the top of the Main Hoop.

In the engineering drawing, we can see that the Main Hoop is supported by two Braces, one on each side. To determine if the Braces are in the correct orientation, we need to compare the angles formed by the Main Hoop and the Braces to the vertical line through the top of the Main Hoop. If the Braces are at a 30-degree angle or more relative to the vertical line, they are considered in the correct orientation.

To measure the angles, we can use the scale bar provided at the top of the drawing. The scale bar shows that 1 mm on the drawing corresponds to 10 mm in reality. By measuring the angles formed by the Main Hoop and the Braces, we can determine if the design complies with rule F.5.9.4.

To determine whether the design complies with rule F.5.9.5, we need to check the dimensions of the Main Hoop Braces in relation to the top of the Main Hoop. In the engineering drawing, the Main Hoop Braces are located below the top of the Main Hoop, and their length is shown as 50 mm. Since the dimension is provided in the engineering drawing, we can compare it to the rule requirements.

F.5.9.5 states that the Main Hoop Braces must be attached 160 mm or less below the top most surface of the Main Hoop. In this case, the Main Hoop Braces are attached at 50 mm below the top most surface of the Main Hoop, which is less than the required 160 mm. Therefore, the design complies with rule F.5.9.5.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.5.9.5 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule F.5.9.5 in the FSAE rule document, we need to examine the dimensions of the vehicle's components and their relation to the driver's helmet. The rule states that the head restraint or mounting must be located at least 250 mm forward of the steering wheel. Additionally, the driver's helmet must be able to fit comfortably within the space between the head restraint and the steering wheel.

In the engineering drawing, the steering wheel is located at the bottom left of the image, and the head restraint or mounting is positioned above it. To measure the distance between the head restraint and the steering wheel, we can use the scale bar provided at the top of the drawing.

First, we measure the distance between the head restraint and the steering wheel. Since the image is in millimeters, we convert the units to millimeters. From the bottom left of the image, we measure 250 mm along the horizontal axis to the right. From the top left of the image, we measure 250 mm downwards to the head restraint.

Next, we need to check if the space between the head restraint and the steering wheel is sufficient for a driver's helmet. To do this, we can use the scale bar to measure the height of the helmet, which should be at least 250 mm. If the height of the helmet is greater than 250 mm, we can confidently say that our design complies with rule F.5.9.5.

Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.6.3.4 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule F.6.3.4, we need to examine the dimensions of the Lower Side Impact Member in the engineering drawing. The rule states that the Lower Side Impact Member must connect the bottom of the Main Hoop and the bottom of the Front Hoop. In the engineering drawing, the Main Hoop is located at the bottom left corner of the image, and the Front Hoop is located in the middle left.

To compute the necessary dimensions, we can use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing. The scale bar indicates that 100 mm on the drawing corresponds to 100 mm in reality. First, we need to measure the distance between the bottom of the Main Hoop and the bottom of the Front Hoop. This distance is approximately 200 mm, which is 2 units on the scale bar. Next, we need to measure the length of the Lower Side Impact Member. From the drawing, we can see that it is approximately 300 mm, which is 3 units on the scale bar.

Based on the measurements, it appears that our design complies with rule F.6.3.4, as the Lower Side Impact Member is at least 240 mm and no more than 320 mm above the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member, and it connects the bottom of the Main Hoop and the bottom of the Front Hoop.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The main hoop is made of a steel tube. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.3.2.1g (which references F.3.4.1) specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:

To determine if our design complies with rule F.3.2.1g (which references F.3.4.1) in the FSAE rule document, we need to analyze the dimensions of the main hoop and compare them to the minimum requirements for steel tubing specified in F.3.4.1.

In the engineering drawing, the main hoop is made of a steel tube, and its dimensions can be computed using the scale bar provided at the top of the drawing. The minimum requirements for steel tubing in F.3.4.1 include four aspects: area, cross-sectional area, moment of inertia, and tube wall thickness.

First, we need to calculate the area of the main hoop. From the engineering drawing, the area of the main hoop can be computed by multiplying the length of the tube by its diameter. However, the drawing does not provide enough information to compute the diameter of the tube.

Next, we can calculate the cross-sectional area of the main hoop by dividing its area by its length.

Moreover, we can calculate the moment of inertia of the main hoop by dividing its area by its length.

Lastly, we can calculate the wall thickness of the main hoop by dividing its area by its length.

Answer:

Since the necessary dimensions are not provided in the drawing, it is impossible to determine if the main hoop complies with rule F.3.2.2.1g) specified in the FSAE rule document."

To determine whether our design complies with rule F.6.4.4b in the FSAE rule document, we need to analyze the dimensions shown in the engineering drawing and compare them to the requirements specified in the rule. F.6.4.4b states that the diagonal side impact member must connect the upper side impact member and lower side impact member forward of the main hoop and rearward of the front hoop.

In the engineering drawing, the diagonal side impact member connects the upper side impact member (located at 240 mm above the lowest point of the lower side impact member) and the lower side impact member (located at 320 mm above the lowest point of the lower side impact member). This configuration meets the rule's requirements, as the diagonal side impact member connects both members in the correct order and orientation.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule F.6.4.4b, we need to measure the distance between the top of the Lower Side Impact Member and the bottom of the Front Hoop. The top of the Lower Side Impact Member is located at 180 mm above the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member, as shown in the engineering drawing. The bottom of the Front Hoop is at 160 mm below the topmost surface of the Front Hoop. The distance between these two points is 340 mm, which is within the required zone of 240 to 320 mm above the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member. Therefore, the design complies with rule F.6.4.4b.

The image shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top, accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The main hoop bracing is made of steel tubes. To determine whether the design complies with rule F.3.2.1h, we need to consider the dimensions of the main hoop bracing and the steel tubes used.

In the image, we can see that the main hoop bracing is made of steel tubes. To check if the tubes meet the minimum requirements as per F.3.4.1, we would need to know the dimensions of the tubes used in the main hoop bracing. Unfortunately, the image does not provide explicit dimensions for the steel tubes.

Therefore, without knowing the dimensions of the steel tubes used in the main hoop bracing, it is not possible to determine whether the design complies with rule F.3.2.1h.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The main hoop bracing is made of steel tubes. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.3.2.1h (which references F.3.4.1) specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule F.3.2.1h, we need to compare the dimensions of the main hoop bracing in the engineering drawing to the minimum requirements for steel tubing specified in F.3.4.1. The rule states that the minimum diameter for the main hoop bracing must be 100 mm. In the engineering drawing, the main hoop bracing measures 100 mm in diameter, so our design complies with this rule.

onfigurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 64 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.
T.4.3 Brake System Encoder - BSE
T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.

with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.
T.4.2.3 The APPS sensors must have different transfer functions which meet one of the two:
• Each sensor has different gradients and/or offsets to the other(s). The circuit must have
a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.

T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the powertrain on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the powertrain on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The scattershield is made from steel and the chain (not pictured) is 13 mm wide. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.5.2.7b specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
The width of the chain is not explicitly shown in the engineering drawing, but it is clear that the scatter shield is made from 2.66 mm minimum thickness steel. The rule T.5.2.7b requires that the chain width be at least three times the width of the chain. Since the width of the chain is not provided, we cannot determine if the design complies with this rule. However, we can confirm that the scatter shield is made from the required minimum thickness steel as per the rule T.5.2.7a.

T.3.4.3 When LED lights are used without a diffuser, they must not be more than 20 mm apart.
T.3.4.4 If a single line of LEDs is used, the minimum length is 150 mm.
T.4 ELECTRONIC THROTTLE COMPONENTS
T.4.1 Applicability
This section T.4 applies only for:
• IC vehicles using Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) IC.4
• EV vehicles
T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
T.4.2.1 The Accelerator Pedal must actuate the APPS T.1.4.1
a. Two springs must be used to return the foot pedal to 0% Pedal Travel
b. Each spring must be capable of returning the pedal to 0% Pedal Travel with the other
disconnected. The springs in the APPS are not acceptable pedal return springs.
T.4.2.2 Two or more electrically separate sensors must be used as APPSs. A single OEM type APPS
with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.
T.4.2.3 The APPS sensors must have different transfer functions which meet one of the two:
• Each sensor has different gradients and/or offsets to the other(s). The circuit must have
a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 64 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.
T.4.3 Brake System Encoder - BSE
T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.

To determine whether our design complies with rule T.5.2.7b, we need to examine the minimum width requirement for the scatter shield. In the engineering drawing, the minimum width requirement for the scatter shield is given by the width of the scatter shield in relation to the width of the chain. Since the chain is 13 mm wide, the minimum width requirement for the scatter shield is 1.7 times the width of the chain, which is 13 mm \* 1.7 = 22.1 mm. We need to check if the width of the scatter shield in the drawing is greater than or equal to 22.1 mm.

To determine whether the design complies with rule T.7.5.b, we need to measure the distance between the front and rear wheel axles and compare it with the specified maximum distance. In the engineering drawing, the front wheel axle is located at 120 mm and the rear wheel axle is located at 140 mm. Therefore, the distance between the front and rear wheel axles is 140 - 120 = 20 mm. This is less than the maximum distance of 250 mm allowed by the rule.

To determine if our design complies with rule T.7.6.1, we need to measure the height of the vehicle as shown in the engineering drawing. The height of the vehicle is measured as the distance from the ground to the highest point of the vehicle. In the engineering drawing, the highest point of the vehicle is the top of the roll cage, which is 1200 mm above the ground. This measurement complies with the rule T.7.6.1, which states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.6.1 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule T.7.6.1, we need to analyze the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing. The drawing shows a vehicle with a length of 4,500 mm, a width of 1,950 mm, and a height of 3,300 mm. Since the vehicle is a race car, it is essential to ensure that it complies with the dimensions specified in the rule.

T.7.6.1 states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device must be inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis, touching the inside of the front tires at the height of the hubs. In our case, the vehicle's dimensions are as follows:

* Length: 4,500 mm
* Width: 1,950 mm
* Height: 3,300 mm

We need to find the location of the front tires relative to the centerline of the chassis. Unfortunately, the image does not provide specific information about the tire placement. However, since it is a race car, we can assume that the front tires are placed in a typical racing car configuration, with the centerline of the chassis passing through the center of the front tires.

Given this assumption, we can now determine if our design complies with T.7.6.1. We need to find the distance between the centerline of the chassis and the inner surface of the front tires. If this distance is within the specified limits (i.e., inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis, touching the inside of the front tires at the height of the hubs), then our design complies with the rule.

To determine whether our design complies with rule T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3) in the FSAE rule document, we need to check the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing and compare them to the specified requirements.

To determine whether the design complies with rule T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3) in the FSAE rule document, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle shown in the engineering drawing to the dimensions specified in the rule. T.7.6.3 states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device located rearward of the centerline of the rear wheel axles must be within the Rear Aerodynamic Zone. T.7.3.3 defines the Rear Aerodynamic Zone as the volume that is rearward of the Head Restraint Plane and inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerline.

In the engineering drawing, we can see the dimensions of the rear tires, the hub centerline, and the height of the vehicle. We can use these dimensions to determine if the vehicle's design complies with the rule.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether our design complies with rule T.7.6.3, we need to compare the dimensions of the Rear Aerodynamic Zone with the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing. The Rear Aerodynamic Zone is defined as the volume that is rearward of the Head Restraint Plane and inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerlines.

In the engineering drawing, the Head Restraint Plane is located at 700 mm above the ground. The hub centerlines are shown as horizontal lines in the CAD views, so we can determine the height of the hub centerlines relative to the ground. The hub centerlines are at a height of 500 mm above the ground.

To determine whether the Rear Aerodynamic Zone is within the allowed dimensions, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing with the dimensions of the Rear Aerodynamic Zone. In the engineering drawing, the width of the vehicle at the rear is 700 mm, and the width of the Rear Aerodynamic Zone is 250 mm. Since the width of the vehicle at the rear is greater than the width of the Rear Aerodynamic Zone, our design complies with rule T.7.6.3.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.7.1a specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:

To determine if the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a in the FSAE rule document, we need to measure the height of the vehicle at the front axle centerline, as shown in the engineering drawing.

First, we locate the front axle centerline, which is the horizontal line that passes through the center of the front wheel. Next, we measure the height of the vehicle at this centerline. In the image, the vehicle's height at the front axle centerline is approximately 115 mm.

According to rule T.7.7.1a, any part of any Aerodynamic Device located forward of the centerline of the front wheel axles and outboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the front tires at the height of the hubs must be no higher than 250 mm above the ground.

In our case, the height of the vehicle at the front axle centerline is 115 mm, which is below the maximum allowed height of 250 mm. Therefore, our design complies with rule T.7.7.1a.

Answer: Yes"

To determine whether the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a, we need to check the height of the vehicle as shown in the engineering drawing. In the image, the vehicle is shown in a top-down view. The height of the vehicle can be measured from the ground to the highest point on the vehicle. Based on the image, the vehicle height is 100 mm. Since the rule states that the vehicle must not be higher than 1200 mm above the ground when in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone, the vehicle height of 100 mm complies with the rule.
