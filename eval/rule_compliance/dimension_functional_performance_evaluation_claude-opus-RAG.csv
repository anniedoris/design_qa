"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,1.png,We should use the battery structure in the vehicle because the stress result in the FEA model is less than the yield strength of non-welded 6061-T6 tubing (240 Mpa).,"Explanation: Based on the FEA results shown in the image, the maximum stress experienced by the aluminum battery structure is around 220 MPa. According to rule F.3.5.3b in the FSAE rulebook, the minimum required properties for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum are:

Yield Strength (Sy) = 240 MPa
Ultimate Strength (Su) = 290 MPa 

Since the maximum stress of 220 MPa is below both the yield strength and ultimate strength requirements, the non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum battery structure meets the strength criteria specified in the rules. Therefore, as long as all other applicable rules are satisfied, this battery structure design would be permitted for use in the FSAE vehicle.

Answer: Yes, based on the FEA results and rule F.3.5.3b, you can use this non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum battery structure in the vehicle, assuming all other relevant rules are met."

According to rule F.3.5.3b in the provided FSAE rule document, the minimum yield strength for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum is specified as 240 MPa. Since the maximum stress exceeds this allowable yield strength, the current design of the battery structure does not meet the requirements and cannot be used in the vehicle as-is. The structure would need to be modified to reduce the maximum stress below the 240 MPa yield strength limit in order to be rules compliant.

Answer: No, the battery structure cannot be used in the vehicle based on the current FEA results and the material requirements specified in rule F.3.5.3b."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows information about the riders that can be accommodated in the vehicle. At the top of the image, there is general anthropomorphic information.

up to 95th percentile male. Based on the data presented, we can see that the data for the largest man and smallest woman that the vehicle can accommodate match the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male anthropomorphic data. Therefore, the vehicle complies with V.2.1.1.","Explanation: Based on the anthropometric data provided in the image, your vehicle is designed to accommodate drivers ranging from the smallest woman (who is approximately 5th percentile female size) up to the largest man (who is approximately 95th percentile male size). The key dimensions like standing height, hip height, erect sitting height, sitting shoulder height, hip width, shoulder grip length, and foot length fall within the 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male ranges specified in the data table.

Rule V.2.1.1 states that ""The vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from 5th percentile female up to 95th percentile male. Accommodation includes driver position, driver controls, and driver equipment.""

Since your vehicle's design accommodates the anthropometric ranges from 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male across the relevant body dimensions, it complies with the driver accommodation requirements specified in rule V.2.1.1.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current.

The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation: Based on the provided graph, the calculated TS voltage reaches a maximum of around 350V. According to rule EV.5.8.4 in the FSAE rulebook, for a maximum TS voltage between 200V and 400V DC, a 10 kOhm current limiting resistor should be used for the Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP). The 10 kOhm resistor is the appropriate value to limit current while still allowing voltage measurement at the TSMP for a TS voltage in the 200-400V range.

The FSAE rules in section EV.5.8.4 specify the resistor values to use for the Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP) based on the maximum TS voltage:

For 400 V DC < Vmax <= 600 V DC, a 15 kOhm resistor should be used.

Since the maximum TS voltage in the graph falls into this 400-600V range, the rules dictate that a 15 kOhm current limiting resistor is required for the TSMP, not the 10 kOhm resistor mentioned in the question. The resistor must be sized appropriately for the maximum voltage that could be present.

Rule F.8.7.2 states that for a standard honeycomb impact attenuator, the allowable peak load is 60 kN.

According to rule F.3.4.2b in the provided FSAE rule document, the minimum yield strength for the steel tubing must be at least 305 MPa (44 ksi). Since the maximum stress from the FEA (250 MPa) is below the minimum required yield strength (305 MPa), this welded steel tube assembly does not meet the strength requirements specified in the rules. The assembly would likely yield and deform under the expected loads.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculation of the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. Based on rule T.3.2.2 in the rule document, did we use correct inputs in our analysis? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,11.png,The input force on the brakes is over the 2000 N required in the rules.,"Explanation: Based on rule T.3.2.2 in the FSAE rulebook, the brake pedal and associated components must be designed to withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure. In the provided analysis image, the input force applied by the driver is listed as 2500 N. This exceeds the 2000 N minimum specified in the rules.

The rules state this 2000 N force is not a design criteria, but rather the brake pedal may be tested by officials pressing the pedal with maximum force. So designing for and analyzing a 2500 N input force should provide sufficient margin to ensure the pedal can withstand the maximum force any official could apply during a test.

Answer: Yes, using a 2500 N input force in your brake pedal stress analysis appears to meet the intent of rule T.3.2.2 and should result in a robust pedal design."

While the 1750 N input is likely sufficient in practical terms, to fully comply with the letter of rule T.3.2.2, the analysis should use an input force of at least 2000 N to confirm the pedal assembly can withstand that load case without failure.
