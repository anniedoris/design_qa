First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,F.5.9.4c.jpg,scale,," Explanation:
The rule states that ""the part of the Main Hoop above its attachment point to the upper Side Impact Tube must be less than 10° from vertical."" To determine if our design complies with this rule, we need to measure the angle between the part of the Main Hoop above its attachment point to the upper Side Impact Tube and the vertical. We can use the scale bar in the engineering drawing to measure this angle. The scale bar shows that 100 mm on the drawing is equal to 1000 mm in real life. We can use this scale to measure the length of the part of the Main Hoop above its attachment point to the upper Side Impact Tube and the length of the vertical distance from the attachment point to the top of the main hoop. We can then use these lengths to calculate the angle between the part of the Main Hoop above its attachment point to the upper Side Impact Tube and the vertical using the arctangent function.

The length of the part of the Main Hoop above its attachment point to the upper Side Impact Tube is 350 mm. The length of the vertical distance from the attachment point to the top of the main hoop is 300 mm. Therefore, the angle between the part of the Main Hoop above its attachment point to the upper Side Impact Tube and the vertical is arctan(350/300) = 49.1°. Since this angle is greater than 10°, our design does not comply with rule F.5.9.4.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.",yes,T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3)c.jpg,scale,," Explanation:
To determine compliance with rule T.7.6.3, we must first determine if any part of our aerodynamic devices is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone as defined in rule T.7.3.3. The rule defines the Rear Aerodynamic Zone as the volume that is:
• Rearward of the Head Restraint Plane
• Inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerline

Using the engineering drawing, we can measure the distance from the Head Restraint Plane to the rearmost point of the aerodynamic devices. The Head Restraint Plane is located at the rearmost portion of the front face of the driver head restraint support, excluding any padding. On the engineering drawing, this corresponds to the vertical line labeled ""Head Restraint Plane"". The rearmost point of the aerodynamic devices is located at the rearmost point of the rear wing, which is shown in the engineering drawing as the pink object that is furthest to the right. We can measure the distance between these two points using the scale bar at the top of the drawing. The distance is approximately 1250 mm.

Next, we must determine if the aerodynamic devices are inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerline. On the engineering drawing, the centerline of the chassis is shown as the vertical line labeled ""Centerline of Chassis"". The inside of the rear tires is shown as the inner edge of the two circles labeled ""Rear Tires"". The two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerline are shown as the two vertical lines labeled ""T.7.6.3 Planes"". We can see that the aerodynamic devices are inboard of these two planes.

Therefore, we can conclude that the aerodynamic devices are located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone.

Rule T.7.6.3 states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. On the engineering drawing, the height of the aerodynamic devices is shown as the vertical distance between the bottom of the aerodynamic devices and the ground. We can measure this distance using the scale bar at the top of the drawing. The height of the aerodynamic devices is approximately 1000 mm.

Therefore, we can conclude that the aerodynamic devices comply with rule T.7.6.3.

Rule T.7.7.1a states that any part of any aerodynamic device that is located in the rear aerodynamic zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing shows that the highest point of the aerodynamic devices is 1190 mm above the ground, which is below the maximum allowed height of 1200 mm.

Answer: yes"
