"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,1.png,We should use the battery structure in the vehicle because the stress result in the FEA model is less than the yield strength of non-welded 6061-T6 tubing (240 Mpa).,"Explanation: According to rule F.3.5.3b, the non-welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in an SES must be:
- Young’s Modulus (E) = 69 GPa (10,000 ksi)
- Yield Strength (Sy) = 240 MPa (34.8 ksi)
- Ultimate Strength (Su) = 290 MPa (42.1 ksi)

The FEA simulation results show that the maximum stress in the battery structure is 220 MPa. This value is below the yield strength of 240 MPa for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum, indicating that the structure will not yield under the simulated loading conditions. Therefore, the battery structure meets the requirements specified in rule F.3.5.3b.

The FEA simulation results show that the maximum stress in the battery structure is 260 MPa. This value is below the ultimate strength (290 MPa) but above the yield strength (240 MPa) of the 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. Since the maximum stress exceeds the yield strength, the structure will undergo plastic deformation under the given loading conditions, which is not acceptable for structural integrity and safety.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current. Based on this image and rule EV.5.8.4 in the rule document, can we use the resistor for TSMP? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’).

The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation: According to rule EV.5.8.4, the resistor value for the Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP) must be chosen based on the maximum TS voltage (Vmax). The rule specifies that for a voltage range of 200 V DC < Vmax <= 400 V DC, a 10 kOhm resistor is required. The image shows that the calculated TS voltage reaches up to approximately 400 V over time. Since the maximum voltage falls within the specified range (200 V DC < Vmax <= 400 V DC), a 10 kOhm resistor is appropriate for limiting the current at the TSMP.

The rule specifies the following resistor values based on the voltage range:

- For Vmax <= 200 V DC, the resistor value should be 5 kOhm.
- For 200 V DC < Vmax <= 400 V DC, the resistor value should be 10 kOhm.
- For 400 V DC < Vmax <= 600 V DC, the resistor value should be 15 kOhm.

From the provided image, the calculated TS voltage reaches up to 600 V over time. Since the maximum TS voltage (Vmax) is 600 V, the appropriate resistor value according to the rule should be 15 kOhm. Therefore, a 10 kOhm resistor would not be suitable for this voltage range.
