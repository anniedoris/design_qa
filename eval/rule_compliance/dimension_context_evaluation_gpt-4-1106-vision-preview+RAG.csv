"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with the rule) followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,V.1.2a.jpg,direct,The image shows the dimension of the cars wheelbase and it is clearly greater than the rules minimum wheelbase.,"No.

Explanation: Rule V.1.2 from the FSAE rule document states that the vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm. The engineering drawing shows a wheelbase dimension of 1549.4 mm, which exceeds the minimum requirement. Therefore, based on the wheelbase dimension provided in the engineering drawing, the design complies with rule V.1.2."

Explanation: Rule V.1.2 from the FSAE rule document states that the vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm. The engineering drawing shows a dimension of 1524.9 mm for the wheelbase, which is 0.1 mm less than the required minimum. Therefore, the design does not comply with rule V.1.2 based on the wheelbase dimension explicitly shown in the engineering drawing."

Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with the rule) followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,V.1.2c.jpg,scale,,"No.

Explanation: Rule V.1.2 from the FSAE rule document states that the vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm. The engineering drawing provided shows a dimension of 3202.4 units on the scale bar, which corresponds to the full length of the scale bar. Without the exact measurement of the wheelbase from the engineering drawing, I cannot compute the actual wheelbase dimension. However, if the scale bar represents the full length of the vehicle and not just the wheelbase, it is likely that the wheelbase is less than the total length of the vehicle, which would mean the wheelbase is less than 3202.4 units. Since the units are in mm, as stated in the question, the wheelbase would need to be at least 1525 mm to comply with the rule. Without a specific wheelbase measurement, I cannot confirm compliance, but based on the information provided, it appears that the wheelbase could potentially be less than the required 1525 mm, hence the design does not comply with rule V.1.2."

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule V.4.1 specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question.

Explanation: Rule V.4.1 specifies that the vehicle must be open-wheeled and open cockpit with four wheels that are not in a straight line. The engineering drawing provided shows a vehicle with four wheels that are not in a straight line, which complies with the rule. However, to fully determine compliance with the open-wheeled requirement, the top 180° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically above, and the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from the side. The engineering drawing does not provide a view from above or a direct side view that clearly shows the top 180° of the wheels/tires unobstructed. Without these explicit dimensions or views, it cannot be confirmed that the design complies with the open-wheeled requirement based solely on the provided engineering drawing."

Explanation: Rule V.4.1 is not listed in the provided context from the FSAE rule document, so I cannot determine compliance with that specific rule. However, if you are referring to the rule V.1.1 regarding the open wheel configuration, the engineering drawing shows a radius of 100.6 mm for the front wheel cover, which does not comply with the rule that states ""The top 180° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically above the wheel."" The wheel cover depicted in the drawing would obstruct the top 180° of the wheel/tire, thus not complying with the open wheel requirement."

Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with the rule) followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,V.4.1c.jpg,scale,,"No.

Explanation: Rule V.1.1 states that the top 180° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically above the wheel, and the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from the side. Additionally, no part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of the outer diameter of the front and rear tires in the side view elevation of the vehicle, with tires steered straight ahead. This keep out zone will extend laterally from the outside plane of the wheel/tire to the inboard plane of the wheel/tire.

Based on the provided engineering drawing and CAD views, it is not possible to accurately determine compliance with the rule without specific measurements of the keep out zones and the unobstructed views of the wheels/tires. The scale bar in the engineering drawing is not sufficient to make these determinations because it does not provide the necessary views or dimensions related to the keep out zones or the unobstructed views required by the rule. Therefore, without additional information or a clear indication that the design meets the specified criteria, the design cannot be confirmed to comply with rule V.1.1."

Explanation: Rule V.1.4.2 from the FSAE rule document specifies that the smaller track of the vehicle (front or rear) must be no less than 75% of the larger track. The engineering drawing provided shows a dimension for the front track (166.1 mm). However, there is no dimension provided for the rear track. Without the rear track dimension, it cannot be determined if the front track is at least 75% of the rear track. Therefore, based on the information provided in the engineering drawing, compliance with rule V.1.4.2 cannot be confirmed."

The drawing shows the required 25mm outer diameter.,"No.

Explanation: Rule F.3.2.1g from the FSAE rule document states that the Main Hoop must be made of steel tubing and does not allow for alternative materials. However, to determine compliance with this rule, we need to know the specific dimensions (diameter and wall thickness) of the steel tubing used for the Main Hoop, as referenced in F.3.4.1. The engineering drawing provided does not show the diameter or wall thickness of the Main Hoop's steel tube; it only shows a dimension of 25.00 mm, which appears to be unrelated to the Main Hoop's steel tube dimensions. Without the explicit dimensions of the Main Hoop's steel tubing, we cannot confirm compliance with rule F.3.2.1g. Since the question instructs only to use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing, and the necessary dimensions for the Main Hoop are not explicitly shown, we must conclude that the design does not comply based on the information provided."

Explanation: Rule F.3.2.1g from the FSAE rule document states that the Main Hoop must be made from a single piece of uncut, continuous, closed section steel tubing. The engineering drawing provided shows a dimension for the Main Hoop, which is 24.30 mm. However, without information on the wall thickness of the tubing, it cannot be determined if the Main Hoop complies with the specific size requirements outlined in F.3.4.1.

Explanation: Rule F.3.2.1g from the FSAE rule document specifies that the Main Hoop must be made from a single piece of uncut, continuous, closed section steel tubing. According to F.3.4.1, the minimum requirements for steel tubing of Size A (which applies to the Main Hoop as per F.3.2.1g) include a minimum outside diameter of 25.0 mm and a minimum wall thickness of 2.0 mm.

The provided engineering drawing includes a scale bar, which can be used to measure the dimensions of the Main Hoop. However, without the ability to measure the drawing directly and without specific dimensions provided for the Main Hoop, it is not possible to confirm whether the Main Hoop meets the minimum outside diameter and wall thickness requirements. Therefore, based on the information available in the image, we cannot verify compliance with the rule. To ensure compliance, the team would need to provide specific measurements of the Main Hoop's outside diameter and wall thickness or use the scale bar in the drawing to calculate these dimensions accurately."

Explanation: Rule F.6.4.4b is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I cannot determine compliance based on that specific rule. However, based on the context given and the typical nature of FSAE rules, which often pertain to structural integrity, material specifications, and safety requirements, I can analyze the provided engineering drawing for any obvious discrepancies related to common FSAE rules.

The engineering drawing shows a side view of the vehicle with dimensions in millimeters. The only dimensions provided are 309.74 mm and 231.56 mm, which do not directly relate to any specific rule mentioned in the provided text. Without the specific rule F.6.4.4b or its requirements, I cannot accurately assess compliance based on the dimensions given in the engineering drawing.

Explanation: Rule T.5.2.7c from the FSAE rule document states that the scatter shield must ""start and end no higher than parallel to the lowest point of the chain wheel/belt/pulley.""

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document.

The scattershield is made from steel and the chain (not pictured) is 13 mm wide. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.5.2.7b specified in the FSAE rule document?

We are told the chain is 13 mm wide and the scatter shield must be at least 3x as wide. The drawing shows the dimension of the width of the scatter shield is 44.3 mm.,"No.

Explanation: Rule T.5.2.7b from the FSAE rule document states that the scatter shield for chains must have a minimum width equal to three times the width of the chain. Since the chain is not pictured, we rely on the provided information that the chain is 13 mm wide. Therefore, the scatter shield must be at least 39 mm wide (3 times 13 mm). The engineering drawing shows a dimension of 44.3 mm for the scatter shield, which exceeds the minimum requirement of 39 mm. However, the rule also specifies that the scatter shield must be centered on the centerline of the chain. Without an explicit dimension showing the position of the chain relative to the scatter shield, we cannot confirm that the scatter shield is centered on the chain. Therefore, based on the information provided and the instructions to use only explicitly shown dimensions, we cannot confirm compliance with rule T.5.2.7b."

The engineering drawing does not provide a direct measurement for the width of the scatter shield, but using the scale bar provided (which shows 1200.9 mm), we can estimate the width of the scatter shield.

The scale bar indicates that the length of the engineering drawing represents 1200.9 mm. By visually comparing the width of the scatter shield to the scale bar, it is clear that the scatter shield is significantly less than one-third of the length of the scale bar. Therefore, the scatter shield is less than 400 mm wide, which is less than the required minimum width of 39 mm to comply with the rule based on the width of the chain. Thus, the design does not comply with rule T.5.2.7b."

The engineering drawing provided shows a section view with a critical fastener, but does not provide an explicit dimension for the length of the bolt projection beyond the nut.

Explanation: Rule T.8.2.4 from the FSAE rule document states that ""A minimum of two full threads must project from any lock nut."" Based on the engineering drawing provided, the scale bar indicates that 300 units in the drawing correspond to 225 mm in reality. To determine the actual size of the features in the drawing, we can use the scale factor derived from the scale bar (225 mm / 300 units = 0.75 mm per unit).

Looking at the section view in the engineering drawing, we need to assess the projection of the threads beyond the lock nut. However, without a clear indication of the length of the bolt's threaded portion beyond the nut or a measurement that can be scaled, we cannot accurately determine if two full threads project from the nut. Additionally, since the fastener has a thread pitch of 1 thread per mm, two full threads would require at least 2 mm of projection.

Without a specific measurement or visible indication that at least 2 mm of the threaded portion projects beyond the nut, we cannot confirm compliance with rule T.8.2.4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the drawing, the design does not comply with the rule."

The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.7.1a specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with the rule) followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,T.7.7.1aa.jpg,direct,"T.7.7.1a says any part of the rear aero can't be more than 1200 mm above the ground, the highest part of the rear wing in the drawing is 1195.27 mm above the ground.","No.

Explanation: Rule T.7.7.1a from the FSAE rule document states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing provided shows the highest point of the rear wing to be at 992.07 mm above the reference plane, which we can assume to be the ground level since no other information is provided. Since 992.07 mm is less than the maximum allowed height of 1200 mm, the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a regarding the height of Aerodynamic Devices in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone."

Explanation: Rule T.7.7.1a from the FSAE rule document states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing shows a dimension of 1201.31 mm from the ground to the top of what appears to be an aerodynamic device (possibly a rear wing), which exceeds the maximum allowed height of 1200 mm by 1.31 mm. Therefore, the design does not comply with rule T.7.7.1a."

Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.7.1a specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with the rule) followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,T.7.7.1ac.jpg,scale,,"No.

Explanation: Rule T.7.7.1a from the FSAE rule document is not provided in the context you've given, so I cannot directly verify compliance with that specific rule. However, based on the information provided, I can infer that the rule likely pertains to the dimensions and positioning of bodywork or aerodynamic devices relative to the vehicle's wheels or axles. To determine compliance, I would need to know the exact requirements of rule T.7.7.1a and be able to measure relevant dimensions on the engineering drawing using the scale bar. Since the rule in question is not included in the provided text and no scale bar is visible in the image, I cannot accurately assess compliance with the rule."
