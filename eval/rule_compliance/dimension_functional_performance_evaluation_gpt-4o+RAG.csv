"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,1.png,We should use the battery structure in the vehicle because the stress result in the FEA model is less than the yield strength of non-welded 6061-T6 tubing (240 Mpa).,"Explanation: Based on the FSAE rule F.3.5.3b, the non-welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 must meet the following minimum requirements for calculations in an SES:
- Young’s Modulus (E): 69 GPa (10,000 ksi)
- Yield Strength (Sy): 240 MPa (34.8 ksi)
- Ultimate Strength (Su): 290 MPa (42.1 ksi)

The FEA simulation results show that the maximum stress in the battery structure is 220 MPa, which is below the yield strength of 240 MPa for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum. This indicates that the structure will not yield under the simulated loading conditions. Additionally, since the ultimate strength is 290 MPa, the structure also has a safety margin before reaching the ultimate failure point.

Therefore, the battery structure made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing meets the requirements specified in the FSAE rules and can be used in the vehicle.

Answer: Yes"

The FEA simulation results show the stress distribution on the battery structure made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The maximum stress observed in the simulation is 260 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of 290 MPa for non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum as specified in the rules. This indicates that the structure can withstand the applied loads without failing.

However, it is also necessary to ensure that the yield strength of 240 MPa is not exceeded in any part of the structure. The FEA results should be closely examined to confirm that the stress does not exceed this value. If the maximum stress in the structure is indeed below 240 MPa, then the structure meets the requirements for yield strength as well.

Given that the FEA results show a maximum stress of 260 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength but potentially above the yield strength, further verification is needed to ensure that the yield strength is not exceeded. If the yield strength is not exceeded, then the structure can be used.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current.

The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation: According to rule EV.5.8.4, each Tractive System Measuring Point (TSMP) must be secured with a current limiting resistor. The resistor value must be chosen based on the maximum TS voltage (Vmax). The rule specifies that for a TS voltage between 200 V DC and 400 V DC, a 10 kOhm resistor should be used. 

From the provided image, the calculated TS voltage over time reaches a maximum of approximately 400 V. This falls within the range specified for using a 10 kOhm resistor (200 V DC < Vmax <= 400 V DC). Therefore, based on the rule and the provided data, a 10 kOhm resistor is appropriate for use with the TSMP in this scenario.

- For 400 V DC < Vmax <= 600 V DC: 15 kOhm

From the provided graph, the calculated TS voltage reaches up to 600 V DC over time. Since the maximum voltage (Vmax) is 600 V DC, the appropriate resistor value according to the rule should be 15 kOhm, not 10 kOhm.

The FEA simulation results show the stress distribution in the assembly of frame tubes. To determine if the assembly is suitable for use, we need to compare the maximum stress values from the FEA results with the yield strength of the steel tubing specified in the rules.

The color scale in the image indicates that the maximum stress in the assembly is around 250 MPa. According to F.3.4.2b, the minimum yield strength for steel tubing is 360 MPa. Since the maximum stress in the assembly (250 MPa) is below the yield strength requirement (360 MPa), the assembly should be able to withstand the applied loads without yielding.
