In the image, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation of the battery structure is shown. The structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document states that if any alternative materials are used, the SES must contain documentation of material type, purchase receipt, shipping document, or letter of donation and calculations that show equivalence to or better than the minimum requirements for steel tubing in the application as listed in F.3.4.1 for yield and ultimate strengths matching the Non Welded Steel properties from F.3.4.2.a above in bending, buckling, and tension.

Based on the image and rule F.3.5.3b, the battery structure appears to be made from a suitable material and has been analyzed through FEA simulation. However, it is important to note that the actual performance of the structure during competition may vary. Therefore, it is advisable to perform additional tests and evaluations to ensure the battery structure's reliability and safety during the competition.

The image shows the results of an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure, which is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document states that the yield strength of the tubing must be at least 240 MPa (240 ksi). From the simulation, we can see that the yield strength of the tubing is 290 MPa (290 ksi), which is greater than the minimum requirement.

However, it is important to note that F.3.5.3b also requires the tubing to be non-welded. The simulation results show that the tubing is non-welded, but we cannot confirm if it is aluminum alloy 6061-T6 or if it meets the other requirements listed in the rule.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current.

The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation:

The image shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. In the context of the Formula SAE rules, the use of a 10 kOhm resistor is discussed in section EV.5.8.4. This resistor is to be used for the TSMP (Tractive System Measuring Points). The purpose of the resistor is to limit the current flowing through the TSMPs and to protect them from damage.

The resistor is placed in series with the TSMPs, which helps to prevent overcurrent and protect the TSMPs from being damaged. The resistor value must be chosen based on the maximum TS voltage and the power dissipated across the TSMPs if they are shorted together. The rule specifies that the resistor must have a continuous power rating greater than the power dissipated across the TSMPs.

Based on the provided image and the rule, it is appropriate to use the 10 kOhm resistor for the TSMPs.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator obtained from experiments. Assuming the impact attenuator is a standard honeycomb type, and based on this image and rule F.8.7.2 in the rule document, can we use the impact attenuator in the vehicle? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,7.png,"F.8.7.2 states that the peak load for a standard honeycomb impact attenuator is 60 kN. The force-displacement curve shows that the peak load is less than 60 kN, so this impact attenuator can be used.","Explanation:
To determine if the impact attenuator can be used in the vehicle, we need to evaluate whether the peak force (95 kN) of the standard honeycomb type meets the force requirement specified in rule F.8.7.2. The force-displacement curve in the image shows that the impact attenuator absorbs a significant amount of energy before reaching its peak force. However, we cannot directly determine the peak force from the image, as it only provides a graphical representation of the force-displacement relationship.

To use the impact attenuator in the vehicle, we need to ensure that it meets the force requirement of 95 kN, as specified in F.8.7.2. If the peak force of the impact attenuator is greater than or equal to 95 kN, it can be used in the vehicle. Otherwise, it may not meet the required force capacity and may not be suitable for the vehicle.

No"

In the image, there is a force applied to the pedal slats, and the stress on the pedal slats is being calculated. Rule T.3.2.2 in the rule document states that the Brake Pedal and associated components design must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure of the Brake System, pedal box, chassis mounting, or pedal adjustment.

To determine whether the inputs used in the analysis are correct, we would need to know the exact force applied on the pedal slats in the image. If the force applied on the pedal slats is less than or equal to 2000 N, then the inputs used in the analysis are correct. However, if the force applied on the pedal slats is greater than 2000 N, then the inputs used in the analysis may not be correct, and the stress on the pedal slats may be underestimated.

Based on Rule T.1.6.1 in the rule document, it is stated that while the driver's feet are touching the pedals, any part of the driver's feet or legs must not extend above or outside of the Major Structure of the Chassis. This rule is aimed at ensuring the driver's safety by preventing them from coming into contact with any sharp edges, moving components, or other hazards inside the cockpit.

In the context of the image, it shows that the temperature of the gearbox components increases over time.
