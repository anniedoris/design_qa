"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows information about the riders that can be accommodated in the vehicle. At the top of the image, there is general anthropomorphic information. Below that, there is information about the largest man and smallest woman our vehicle can accommodate.
