"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing.

However, for non-welded aluminum tubing, the rule does not specify a minimum wall thickness. The image provided shows the results of an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure, which is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The simulation results indicate the stress distribution across the structure under a given load, but they do not provide information about the wall thickness of the tubing used.

To determine if the battery structure can be used in the vehicle, we would need to ensure that the actual wall thickness of the non-welded aluminum tubing meets any specific requirements set forth by the competition rules for non-welded applications, as well as any additional structural integrity criteria that may be applicable to ensure safety and performance. Since the provided rule excerpt and image do not give information about the wall thickness or any other specific non-welded tubing requirements, we cannot conclusively determine the compliance of the battery structure based solely on the provided information.

Answer: No (based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine compliance with the rules)"

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current.

The rule specifies the resistor value based on the maximum Tractive System (TS) voltage. For a maximum TS voltage of 400 V DC or less, a 10 kOhm resistor is required.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator obtained from experiments. Assuming the impact attenuator is a standard honeycomb type, and based on this image and rule F.8.7.2 in the rule document, can we use the impact attenuator in the vehicle?

The force-displacement curve shows that the peak load is less than 60 kN, so this impact attenuator can be used.","Explanation: According to rule F.8.7.2, the impact attenuator must be tested to ensure that it does not exceed the peak deceleration specified in F.8.8.2, which is 20 g average and 40 g peak. The force-displacement curve provided in the image shows that the force gradually increases with displacement until it reaches a plateau. The curve does not show any sharp peaks that would indicate a sudden increase in deceleration, which could exceed the peak deceleration limits. However, to determine if the impact attenuator can be used in the vehicle, the actual deceleration values need to be calculated based on the mass of the vehicle and the force values from the curve. The rule also requires that the energy absorbed must be more than 7350 J. This information is not provided in the image, so it cannot be determined from the force-displacement curve alone whether the impact attenuator meets the energy absorption requirement.

Answer: No, based on the provided image alone, we cannot confirm if the impact attenuator can be used in the vehicle as we do not have sufficient information to determine if it meets the deceleration and energy absorption requirements specified in the rules."

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on an assembly of frame tubes. The frame tubes are made from welded steel tubing.

The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 250 MPa, which exceeds the yield strength. Therefore this assembly should not be used.","Explanation: The image provided shows an FEA simulation with a color-coded stress distribution on a welded steel tubing assembly. The colors represent different stress levels experienced by the assembly under simulated load conditions. According to rule F.3.4.2b from the rule document, the welded properties for steel tubing to be used in calculations must have a yield strength (Sy) of 180 MPa and an ultimate strength (Su) of 300 MPa. The maximum stress shown in the FEA simulation is 250 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of 300 MPa specified in the rule. Since the maximum stress in the simulation does not exceed the ultimate strength, the assembly would not be expected to fail under the simulated load conditions. However, it is important to note that the yield strength is the stress level at which permanent deformation begins, and operating close to this limit could lead to material fatigue or failure over time. Therefore, while the assembly may be structurally sound for the simulated conditions, it is crucial to consider safety factors, fatigue life, and the specific loading conditions the assembly will experience in the vehicle.

The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 150 MPa, which is less than the yield strength. This assembly can be used.","Explanation: The image shows an FEA simulation of an assembly of frame tubes, which are color-coded based on the stress levels experienced by different sections of the assembly. The color scale indicates that the stress values range from 0 MPa to 150 MPa. According to rule F.3.4.2b from the rule document, the welded properties for steel tubing used in calculations must have a minimum yield strength (Sy) of 180 MPa and a minimum ultimate strength (Su) of 300 MPa. The FEA simulation results must be compared to these values to determine if the assembly is structurally sound for use in the vehicle. If the maximum stress in the assembly during the simulation is below the yield strength of 180 MPa, then the assembly has not yielded and can be considered safe for use. However, if the maximum stress exceeds this value, the assembly may not be safe as it could experience plastic deformation or failure.

Answer: Without specific numerical values for the stress at critical points in the assembly, it is not possible to give a definitive yes or no answer. The decision would depend on whether the maximum stress in any part of the assembly exceeds the yield strength of 180 MPa as per the rule. If the maximum stress is below 180 MPa, then yes, the assembly can be used. If it exceeds 180 MPa, then no, the assembly should not be used."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculation of the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal.

This rule is intended to ensure the structural integrity and reliability of the brake pedal assembly under significant load, as it is a critical safety component of the vehicle.

In the provided image, the analysis shows calculations for the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. The force input for the analysis is 3500 N, which is greater than the minimum requirement of 2000 N specified in the rules. This means that the team has considered a higher load than the minimum required for their stress analysis, which is a conservative approach to ensure safety and compliance with the rules.

The inputs for the analysis, such as the distance, angles, and material properties, appear to be specific to the team's design and are used to calculate the stress on the pedal slats. As long as these inputs accurately represent the actual design and material properties of the pedal assembly, and the analysis is conducted correctly, the team is following the intent of rule T.3.2.2 by testing the pedal assembly beyond the minimum force requirement.

According to rule F.3.5.3b from the rule document, if welding is used on a regulated aluminum structure, the equivalent yield strength must be considered in the ""as welded"" condition for the alloy used unless the team provides detailed proof that the frame or component has been properly solution heat treated, artificially aged, and not subject to heating during team manufacturing. Since the frame is specified as non-welded, this rule does not directly apply to the welding of the frame itself. However, the rule implies the importance of considering the effects of welding on the strength of aluminum components. If the motor mount is welded to the frame, the team must ensure that the welding process does not compromise the strength of the mount or the frame, especially if the mount is also made from aluminum. The FEA results must be compared to the yield strength of the material used for the motor mount, and if the maximum stress is below the yield strength, the mount could be considered safe for use.
