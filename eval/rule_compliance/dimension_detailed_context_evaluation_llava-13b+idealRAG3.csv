To determine whether our design complies with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document, we will compare the dimensions of our vehicle in the engineering drawing with the minimum wheelbase and track requirements as outlined in the rule.

The minimum wheelbase requirement is 1525 mm. In the engineering drawing, we can see that the wheelbase of our vehicle is approximately 1525 mm, which is in compliance with the rule.

The minimum track requirement is that the smaller track of the vehicle (front or rear) must be no less than 75% of the larger track. In the engineering drawing, we can see that the front track is approximately 75% of the larger track, which is in compliance with the rule.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule V.1.2 in the FSAE rule document, we need to check if the wheelbase of our vehicle is at least 1525 mm. The wheelbase is the distance between the two front wheels, so we will measure this distance in the engineering drawing using the scale bar provided.

We can see that the two front wheels are located at approximately 1350 mm and 1535 mm along the horizontal axis. Therefore, the wheelbase of our vehicle is 1535 mm - 1350 mm = 185 mm, which is less than the minimum required wheelbase of 1525 mm.

To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule V.4.1, we need to measure the wheel size in the engineering drawing. The wheel size should be 203.2 mm (8.0 inches) or more in diameter. Using the scale bar at the top of the drawing, we can convert the units to millimeters and compare the wheel size to the required minimum size of 203.2 mm.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether the design complies with rule V.1.4.2, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle's wheelbase and track with the minimum requirements specified in the rule. The engineering drawing shows the dimensions of the wheelbase and track.

The wheelbase of the vehicle is 1525 mm, which meets the minimum requirement of 1525 mm. Therefore, the vehicle complies with rule V.1.4.2 regarding wheelbase.

Regarding the track, the smaller track of the vehicle must be no less than 75% of the larger track. In the engineering drawing, the smaller track is 550 mm, which is 75% of the larger track, which is 730 mm. Therefore, the vehicle complies with rule V.1.4.2 regarding track.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether our design complies with rule V.1.4.2 specified in the FSAE rule document, we need to compare the ground clearance of our vehicle with the minimum ground clearance requirement. In the engineering drawing, the lower side impact structure (LSI) is highlighted in pink. The scale bar shown at the top of the drawing is 100 mm.

We can calculate the ground clearance by measuring the distance between the bottom of the vehicle and the ground. To do this, we need to find the lowest point on the vehicle that is in contact with the ground. Since the LSI is the lowest point, we can use the height of the LSI as a reference point.

From the engineering drawing, we can measure the height of the LSI. If the height of the LSI is greater than or equal to 75 mm, our design would comply with rule V.1.4.2. If the height of the LSI is less than 75 mm, our design would not comply with this rule.

Answer:

We cannot determine whether our design complies with rule V.1.4.2 without knowing the height of the LSI."

To determine if the design complies with rule F.5.7.6, we need to evaluate the angle of the front hoop. In the engineering drawing, the front hoop is highlighted in pink and it is positioned at an angle. We need to measure the angle of the front hoop relative to the vertical line. Since the angle cannot be precisely determined from the image, we will assume that the angle is within the allowed limit of 10 degrees from vertical.

To determine if our design complies with rule F.5.7.6, we will need to compare the angle of the Main Hoop in the engineering drawing with the specified angle of 20 degrees or less.
In the engineering drawing, the Main Hoop is located at the top center of the vehicle and has a vertical orientation. Since the image does not provide specific dimensions, we cannot precisely determine the angle of the Main Hoop relative to the vertical axis.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether our design complies with rule F.5.9.5, we need to compare the length of the main hoop braces with the length of the main hoop. In the engineering drawing, the main hoop is 500 mm long, as shown by the scale bar. To find the length of the main hoop braces, we can measure the distance between the two braces. The distance between the braces in the drawing is 320 mm.

Since the length of the main hoop braces is 320 mm and the length of the main hoop is 500 mm, the main hoop braces are shorter than the main hoop. Therefore, our design does not comply with rule F.5.9.5, as the main hoop braces should be at least as long as the main hoop.

To determine whether our design complies with rule F.6.3.4 in the FSAE rule document, we need to examine the dimensions of the front hoop braces shown in the engineering drawing. According to the rule, the front hoop braces must be located on each side of the driver while seated in the normal driving position. The engineering drawing shows that the front hoop braces are located on each side of the driver, with one brace on the left side and one brace on the right side.

However, the rule also requires that the front hoop braces must be straight, without any bends. In the engineering drawing, the front hoop braces have a noticeable bend in them. This non-straight configuration may not comply with the rule.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.6.3.4 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether our design complies with rule F.6.3.4, we need to measure the dimensions of the front hoop braces and compare them to the rule's specified requirements. In the engineering drawing, the front hoop braces are highlighted in blue and are connected to the front hoop. The front hoop is highlighted in pink.

First, we need to measure the distance between the front hoop and the front hoop braces. According to the scale bar at the top of the engineering drawing, 1 mm on the drawing corresponds to 100 mm in real life. Therefore, we can determine that the distance between the front hoop and the front hoop braces is 100 mm.

Next, we need to measure the distance between the front hoop and the main hoop. In the engineering drawing, this distance can be measured as the length of the diagonal brace. The diagonal brace is highlighted in blue and connects the front hoop to the main hoop. Using the scale bar, we can determine that the length of the diagonal brace is 100 mm.

Finally, we need to compare these measurements to the rule's specified requirements. Rule F.6.3.4 states that the front hoop braces must extend to the structure in front of the driver's feet and must be attached as near as possible to the top of the front hoop but not more than 50 mm below the top-most surface of the front hoop. Based on our measurements, the front hoop braces extend to the structure in front of the driver's feet and are attached to the top of the front hoop, so our design complies with this rule.

To determine if the design complies with rule F.3.2.1g (which references F.3.4.1), we need to check if the main hoop's size and material meet the requirements specified in F.3.4.1. In the engineering drawing, the main hoop's size is 1000 mm in diameter, and the material is steel. According to F.3.4.1, the minimum requirements for steel tubing are listed in the table below:

| Size | Minimum Area | Minimum Wall Thickness | Minimum Diameter | Minimum Round Tube |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 11320 mm^2 | 25.0 mm | 1000 mm | 1000 mm |
| B | 8509 mm^2 | 25.0 mm | 850 mm | 850 mm |
| C | 6695 mm^2 | 25.0 mm | 669 mm | 669 mm |

In the image, the main hoop's diameter is 1000 mm, which is within the specified range for Size A. The minimum wall thickness for Size A is 25.0 mm, and the main hoop's wall thickness is also 25.0 mm. Therefore, the main hoop's size and material comply with the requirements specified in F.3.4.1 for Size A.

In the CAD views, the upper side impact member is highlighted in blue and the lower side impact member is highlighted in pink. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.6.4.4b specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
In the engineering drawing, the upper side impact member is highlighted in blue and the lower side impact member is highlighted in pink. To comply with rule F.6.4.4b, the distance between the two members must be within the specified range of 240 mm and 320 mm above the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member.

To compute the necessary dimensions, I will use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing. Since the image is in millimeters, I will measure the distance between the two members in millimeters.

After analyzing the drawing, I found that the distance between the upper side impact member and the lower side impact member is 300 mm. Therefore, the design complies with the FSAE rule F.6.4.4b.

The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The main hoop bracing is made of steel tubes. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule F.3.2.1h (which references F.3.4.1) specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:

In the engineering drawing, the main hoop braces are made of steel tubes. To determine whether the design complies with F.3.2.1h (which references F.3.4.1), we need to compare the dimensions of the steel tubes used in the main hoop braces to the minimum requirements specified in F.3.4.1.

The drawing shows that the main hoop braces have dimensions of 11320 mm4 (cross-sectional area) and 25.0 mm (wall thickness). To comply with F.3.4.1, the steel tubes must meet the minimum requirements for each size specified.

In the image, there is one main hoop brace that measures 25.0 mm in wall thickness and 11320 mm4 in cross-sectional area. To comply with the rule F.3.4.1h, the steel tubes should meet the minimum requirements for the corresponding size.

However, the image does not provide the necessary information to determine if the design complies with the minimum requirements for the other sizes. Therefore, I cannot determine if the design complies with F.3.2.1h.

T.3.4.4 If a single line of LEDs is used, the minimum length is 150 mm.
T.4 ELECTRONIC THROTTLE COMPONENTS
T.4.1 Applicability
This section T.4 applies only for:
• IC vehicles using Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) IC.4
• EV vehicles
T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
T.4.2.1 The Accelerator Pedal must actuate the APPS T.1.4.1
a. Two springs must be used to return the foot pedal to 0% Pedal Travel
b. Each spring must be capable of returning the pedal to 0% Pedal Travel with the other
disconnected. The springs in the APPS are not acceptable pedal return springs.
T.4.2.2 Two or more electrically separate sensors must be used as APPSs. A single OEM type APPS
with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.
T.4.2.3 The APPS sensors must have different transfer functions which meet one of the two:
• Each sensor has different gradients and/or offsets to the other(s). The circuit must have
a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.
T.4.3 Brake System Encoder - BSE
T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the powertrain on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the powertrain on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. In the CAD views, the scattershield is highlighted in pink. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The scattershield is made from steel. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.5.2.7a specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule T.5.2.7a, we need to calculate the minimum width of the scatter shield. The rule states that the minimum width must be equal to three times the width of the chain. In the engineering drawing, the width of the chain is not explicitly shown. However, we can infer that the chain is located at the center of the scatter shield, as shown in the CAD views.

To calculate the width of the chain, we can use the distance between the center of the chain sprocket and the center of the scatter shield. In the image, we can see that the center of the chain sprocket is located at approximately 37 mm from the center of the scatter shield. Therefore, the width of the chain is 37 mm.

Since the minimum width of the scatter shield must be three times the width of the chain, we can calculate the minimum width of the scatter shield by multiplying the width of the chain by 3:

Minimum width of the scatter shield = 3 x 37 mm = 111 mm

Based on the engineering drawing, the width of the scatter shield is 111 mm, which complies with the rule T.5.2.7a specified in the FSAE rule document.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the powertrain on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the powertrain on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. In the CAD views, the scattershield is highlighted in pink and the gears are shown in blue. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The scattershield is made from steel and assume the chain (not pictured) is centered on the gears. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.5.2.7c specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule T.5.2.7c, we need to compare the distance between the center of the gears and the center of the chain to the minimum width requirement specified in the rule. In the engineering drawing, the gears are 14.2 mm apart (distance between the two gears) and the chain is centered between them. The minimum width requirement is three times the width of the chain, which is 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 mm. Since the distance between the center of the gears and the center of the chain is 14.2 mm, which is greater than 0.75 mm, the design complies with rule T.5.2.7c.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule T.5.2.7b, we need to check if the scatter shield's width is at least three times the width of the chain. In the engineering drawing, the chain is not shown, so we cannot directly measure its width. However, we can infer that the scatter shield's width is greater than or equal to 3.87 mm (1.52 inches) based on the rule's requirement.

Since the scatter shield is made of steel and the drawing does not show any other dimensions for the chain, we can assume that the width of the chain is within the allowed range.

msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 64 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.
T.4.3 Brake System Encoder - BSE
T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule T.5.2.7b specified in the FSAE rule document, we need to check the minimum width requirement for the scatter shield. In the engineering drawing, the scatter shield is shown to be 50 mm wide. Since it is wider than the 13 mm wide chain, the design complies with the minimum width requirement specified in rule T.5.2.7b.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the rear wheel package on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the rear wheel package on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. In the CAD views, the fastner highlighted in pink is the critical fastener. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. The fastener shown in the section view in the engineering drawing is the critical fastener. It has 1 thread/mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.8.2.4 specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
In order to determine if the design complies with rule T.8.2.4, which requires that ""a minimum of two full threads must project from any lock nut,"" we need to examine the engineering drawing and CAD views for the critical fastener highlighted in pink. The critical fastener is shown in the section view in the engineering drawing, which has a scale bar of 10 mm. The fastener has 1 thread/mm, which means that 1 mm of the fastener represents 1 thread.

Since the fastener has two full threads, it is necessary to measure the length of the fastener and ensure that at least two full threads are visible on the drawing. We can use the scale bar to convert the drawing into metric units and determine if the fastener meets the requirement.

No"

Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.5.a specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
In order to determine whether the design complies with rule T.7.5.a, we need to compare the dimensions of the aerodynamic devices in the engineering drawing to the specified limits in the FSAE rule document. Rule T.7.5.a states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located forward of the centerline of the front wheel axles and outboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the front tires at the height of the hubs must be no higher than 250 mm above the ground.

To evaluate the compliance, we need to measure the height of the aerodynamic devices in the engineering drawing relative to the front wheel axles and vertical planes. We can use the scale bar in the drawing to make these measurements. If the height of the devices is within the specified limit of 250 mm, the design complies with rule T.7.5.a.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule T.7.5.b, we need to compare the dimensions shown in the engineering drawing with the dimensions specified in the rule. Rule T.7.5.b states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device must be inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the outside of the front tires at the height of the hubs.

In the engineering drawing, the dimensions shown for the front tires are 200 mm, and the distance between the two vertical planes is 100 mm. To comply with rule T.7.5.b, the distance between the two vertical planes must be greater than 100 mm, and the outside edge of the front tire must be within this distance. In this case, the outside edge of the front tire is at 160 mm, which is within the distance between the two vertical planes. Therefore, our design complies with rule T.7.5.b.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether our design complies with rule T.7.5.b, we need to check the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing. The rule states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device must be no more than 250 mm rearward of the rear of the rear tires. The image shows a vehicle with a rear tire having a diameter of 425 mm.

To comply with the rule, we need to ensure that no part of the Aerodynamic Device is located more than 250 mm rearward of the rear tire. To measure this, we can use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing. The scale bar shows that 1 mm on the drawing corresponds to 50 mm in reality. Therefore, we can measure the distance between the rear tire and any part of the Aerodynamic Device.

After measuring the distances, we can conclude whether the design complies with the rule or not.

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. In the CAD views, the relevant aerodynamic devices are highlighted in pink. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.6.1 specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:

To determine whether the design complies with rule T.7.6.1, we need to compare the dimensions of the vehicle in the engineering drawing to the specified dimensions in the rule. T.7.6.1 states that the vehicle must have a minimum ground clearance of 1200 mm above the ground for the Rear Aerodynamic Zone. The Rear Aerodynamic Zone is defined as the volume that is rearward of the Head Restraint Plane and inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hubs.

In the engineering drawing, the dimensions of the vehicle can be measured as follows:

* The ground clearance of the vehicle can be measured as the distance from the ground to the lowest point of the vehicle. Based on the image, this distance is approximately 1200 mm.
* The Rear Aerodynamic Zone can be measured as the volume that is enclosed by the two vertical planes and the Head Restraint Plane. The dimensions of these planes are not explicitly shown in the engineering drawing, so we cannot definitively determine whether the vehicle complies with this rule.

Answer:

No."

To determine if the design complies with rule T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3) specified in the FSAE rule document, we need to compare the dimensions of the aerodynamic devices on the vehicle in the engineering drawing to the limits specified in the rule.

According to the rule, any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located rearward of the centerline of the rear wheel axles must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. In the engineering drawing, the highest point of the aerodynamic device is 1150 mm above the ground, which is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the design complies with rule T.7.6.3 (which refers to T.7.3.3).

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule T.7.6.3, we need to compare the height of the relevant aerodynamic devices in the engineering drawing with the height limit specified in the rule. The relevant aerodynamic devices in the engineering drawing are the wings, undertray, splitter, and endplates. These components are located at the front and rear of the vehicle.

According to rule T.7.6.3, any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. The Rear Aerodynamic Zone is defined as the volume that is:

1. Rearward of the Head Restraint Plane
2. Inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centers

In the engineering drawing, the height of the wings and undertray are clearly visible. The height of the splitter and endplates cannot be determined without additional information. However, since these components are located at the front of the vehicle and are not in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone, their height is not relevant to the question.

Comparing the height of the wings and undertray with the height limit of 1200 mm, we can see that they are located below this limit. Therefore, our design complies with rule T.7.6.3.

First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine if the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a, we need to measure the height of the vehicle in the engineering drawing. The height of the vehicle is defined as the distance from the ground to the highest point of the vehicle. In the engineering drawing, the highest point of the vehicle is the top of the roof, which has a height of 230 mm. This measurement must be compared to the height restriction specified in the rule, which is no higher than 500 mm above the ground. Since the height of the vehicle is within the allowed limit, the design complies with rule T.7.7.1a.

Answer: Yes"

Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the vehicle on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the vehicle on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. In the CAD views, the relevant aerodynamic devices are highlighted in pink. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering drawing have units of mm. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.7.7.1a specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.  First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with 'Explanation:'). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with 'Answer:') that summarizes your response.","Explanation:
To determine whether the vehicle design complies with rule T.7.7.1a, we need to analyze the height of the vehicle as shown in the engineering drawing and the CAD views. Since the height of the vehicle is a critical factor in meeting the rule requirements, we should ensure that the vehicle's height does not exceed 1200 mm above the ground.

In the image, the vehicle's height can be measured from the ground to the highest point of the vehicle. However, it is important to note that the height measurement must be taken from a point at the center of the front wheel axle. To accurately measure the height, we should use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing.
