"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document.

Explanation: Rule V.1.1 part c specifies a keep out zone extending 75 mm in front of and behind the outer diameter of the front and rear tires, projected vertically. No part of the vehicle may enter this zone. The engineering drawing provides the wheelbase dimension of 1549.4 mm, but does not specify the front and rear track widths or the exact positioning of the wheels/tires. Without knowing the location of the wheels/tires, it's not possible to assess if any parts of the body or aerodynamic devices impinge on the 75 mm keep out areas. The six CAD views suggest the body is quite narrow, but the exact measurements relative to the tires cannot be determined from the information given.

Answer: Unable to determine compliance based on the limited dimensions provided in the engineering drawing. More information is needed regarding the track widths and tire locations to assess if the 75 mm keep out zones are maintained."

Explanation: Rule V.1.2 states that no part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of the outer diameter of the front and rear tires, when viewed from the side with the tires steered straight ahead.

The engineering drawing shows the overall length of the vehicle is 1524.9 mm. However, it does not explicitly dimension the position of the tires relative to the front and rear of the vehicle bodywork/chassis. Without knowing how far the tires are inset from the extreme front and rear of the vehicle, it cannot be definitively determined from this drawing alone whether any parts enter the 75 mm keep out zones.

If the front and rear tires are inset from the vehicle extremes by at least 75 mm each, then the design would comply. But this cannot be confirmed without those dimensions being called out. 

Since you stated dimensions not explicitly shown can be assumed to comply, the conservative assumption would be the design complies, but this is not directly validated by the drawing.

Answer: Yes, based on the stated assumptions."

The wheelbase is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.

Using the provided scale of 3202.4 mm total vehicle length, I can estimate the wheelbase by measuring it on the drawing and scaling proportionally.

The wheelbase line measures approximately 60% of the total length line. 
60% of 3202.4 mm = 0.6 * 3202.4 mm = 1921.44 mm

Since 1921.44 mm is greater than the 1525 mm minimum required by rule V.1.2, the design appears to be in compliance with the minimum wheelbase requirement based on the provided drawing.

Answer: Yes, the design complies with rule V.1.2's minimum wheelbase requirement of 1525 mm."

Explanation: The engineering drawing shows the overall length (R203.2) and width between the wheels, but does not provide the specific dimensions needed to assess the open wheel requirements of V.4.1. The rule states the wheels must be unobstructed when viewed from the side, and no part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone extending 75 mm in front of and behind the outer tire diameter. Without the diameter of the tires or the positioning of bodywork relative to the tires explicitly dimensioned, there is insufficient information to conclusively determine if the 75 mm keep out zones are maintained.

Explanation: Rule V.1.4.2 states ""The smaller track of the vehicle (front or rear) must be no less than 75% of the larger track."" The engineering drawing shows the front track width (labeled as R203.2) is 203.2 mm. The rear track width is not explicitly dimensioned, so per your instructions, I will assume it complies with the rules. Since only the front track width is given and the rear is not specified, there is not enough information in the drawing alone to determine if the smaller track is at least 75% of the larger track.

To check compliance, I'll measure the front and rear track widths from the top view engineering drawing using the provided scale.

The scale shows 3202.4 mm total vehicle length. On the drawing, this spans about 130 mm. So the scale is roughly 24.6 mm drawing length per 1000 mm actual size.

The front track measures about 47 mm on the drawing. Converting:
47 mm * (1000 mm / 24.6 mm) = 1910 mm actual front track width

The rear track measures about 50 mm on the drawing. Converting:
50 mm * (1000 mm / 24.6 mm) = 2033 mm actual rear track width

The front track is smaller at 1910 mm. 75% of the larger rear 2033 mm track is:
2033 mm * 0.75 = 1525 mm

Since the smaller front 1910 mm track exceeds 75% of the larger rear 2033 mm track, the vehicle appears to meet the track width requirement of V.1.3.2."

Explanation: The engineering drawing shows the overall length (239.48 mm) but does not specify the wheelbase or the height of any bodywork components in front of the front axle. Rule F.5.7.5 states that bodywork in that area must be no higher than 250 mm above the ground.

Explanation: Rule F.5.7.5 states that the top of the front hoop must be no more than 250 mm below the top of the main hoop, and the bottom of the main hoop must be no more than 350 mm above the lowest point of the upper chassis member. The engineering drawing shows the top of the main hoop is 261.57 mm above some reference point, but the height of the front hoop top is not dimensioned.

Explanation: Rule F.5.9.4 states that on vehicles with a wheelbase of less than 1520 mm, the front hoop bracing attachment point must be no higher than 50 mm below the top of the front hoop. The engineering drawing shows an overall length of 2761.06 mm, but does not explicitly dimension the wheelbase. Without knowing if the wheelbase is less than 1520 mm, and without any dimensions locating the front hoop bracing attachment point, compliance to F.5.9.4 cannot be determined solely from the information given in the drawing.

Using the scale bar, each small square represents 10 mm, and the main hoop bracing tubes span about 2.5 squares.

Rule F.3.2.1.h states that the main hoop bracing must meet Size B steel tubing requirements. Referencing the table in F.3.4.1, Size B tubing must have an outside diameter of at least 25.0 mm and a wall thickness of at least 2.0 mm.

The drawing specifies the outer diameter of the main hoop bracing as approximately 25 mm, which meets the minimum 25.0 mm requirement. However, the wall thickness is not explicitly labeled in the engineering drawing. Without knowing the wall thickness, it cannot be definitively determined if the main hoop bracing fully complies with the Size B steel tubing requirements in rule F.3.4.1.

Answer: Unable to determine compliance based solely on the provided engineering drawing, as the wall thickness of the main hoop bracing tubes is not specified."

The scatter shield does appear to be generally centered on the drivetrain components. Assuming the chain is also centered on the gears as stated, the shield would likely meet the ""centered on the chain"" requirement.

So in summary, the centering looks okay, but compliance to the width requirement cannot be confirmed without the chain width dimension. More information is needed to fully assess rule T.5.2.7c compliance.

Rule T.7.3.3 defines the Rear Aerodynamic Zone as extending no more than 250 mm rearward of the rear of the rear tires.

The engineering drawing does not explicitly show the position of the rear wheel axle centerline or the rearmost point of the rear tires. Without those dimensions, it's not possible to definitively determine if any aerodynamic devices behind the rear axle are within 250 mm of the rear of the rear tires, and thus compliant with T.7.6.3.

However, based on the overall 228.85 mm vehicle length and the proportions shown in the drawing and CAD views, it seems unlikely that any aerodynamic devices would extend more than 250 mm behind the rear tires. The rear bodywork appears to taper significantly. But without explicit dimensions locating the rear axle and rear of the tires, strict compliance to the rule cannot be confirmed.
