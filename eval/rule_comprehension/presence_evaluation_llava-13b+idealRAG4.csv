b. Energy absorbed must be more than 7350 J
When:
• Total mass of Vehicle is 300 kg
• Impact velocity is 7.0 m/s
F.8.8.3 When using the Standard Impact Attenuator, the SES must meet the following:
a. Test data will not be submitted
b. All other requirements of this section must be included.
c. Photos of the actual attenuator must be included
d. Evidence that the Standard IA meets the design criteria provided in the Standard Impact
Attenuator specification must be included with the SES. This may be a receipt or packing
slip from the supplier.
F.8.8.4 The Impact Attenuator Data Report when NOT using the Standard Impact Attenuator must
include:
a. Test data that proves that the Impact Attenuator Assembly meets the Functional
Requirements F.8.8.2

F.8.8.5 The Impact Attenuator Test is valid for only one Competition Year
F.8.8.6 Impact Attenuator Test Setup
a. During any test, the Impact Attenuator must be attached to the Anti Intrusion Plate using
the intended vehicle attachment method.
b. The Impact Attenuator Assembly must be attached to a structurally representative
section of the intended chassis.
The test fixture must have equivalent strength and stiffness to a baseline front bulkhead.
A solid block of material in the shape of the front bulkhead is not “structurally
representative”.
c. There must be 50 mm minimum clearance rearwards of the Anti Intrusion Plate to the
test fixture.
d. No part of the Anti Intrusion Plate may permanently deflect more than 25 mm beyond
the position of the Anti Intrusion Plate before the test.
The 25 mm spacing represents the front bulkhead support and insures that the plate does not
intrude excessively into the cockpit.
F.8.8.7 Test Conduct
a. Composite Impact Attenuators must be Dynamic Tested.
Other Impact Attenuator constructions may be Dynamic Tested or Quasi-Static Tested
b. Dynamic Testing (sled, pendulum, drop tower, etc.) of the Impact Attenuator must be
conducted at a dedicated test facility. This facility may be part of the University, but must
be supervised by professional staff or the University faculty. Teams must not construct
their own dynamic test apparatus.
c. Quasi-Static Testing may be performed by teams using their University’s
facilities/equipment, but teams are advised to exercise due care when performing all
tests.
F.8.8.8 Test Analysis
a. When using acceleration data from the dynamic test, the average deceleration must be
calculated based on the raw unfiltered data.
b. If peaks above the 40 g limit are present in the data, a Channel Filter Class (CFC) 60
