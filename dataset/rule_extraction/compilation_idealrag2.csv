a. Two springs must be used to return the foot pedal to 0% Pedal Travel
b. Each spring must be capable of returning the pedal to 0% Pedal Travel with the other
disconnected. The springs in the APPS are not acceptable pedal return springs.
IC.4.5 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
Refer to T.4.2 for specific requirements of the APPS
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.

with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above

a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
