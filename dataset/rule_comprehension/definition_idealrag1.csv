Each competition gives teams the chance to demonstrate their creativity and engineering
skills in comparison to teams from other universities around the world.
GR.1.4 Vehicle Design Objectives
GR.1.4.1 Teams are to assume that they work for an engineering firm that is designing, fabricating,
testing and demonstrating a prototype vehicle.
GR.1.4.2 The vehicle should have high performance and be sufficiently durable to successfully complete
all the events at the Formula SAE competitions.
GR.1.4.3 Additional design factors include: aesthetics, cost, ergonomics, maintainability, and
manufacturability.
GR.1.4.4 Each design will be judged and evaluated against other competing designs in a series of Static
and Dynamic events to determine the vehicle that best meets the design goals and may be
profitably built and marketed.

wheel centerline and driver’s shoulder level vertically and
approximately on vehicle centerline laterally.
T.3.4.3 When LED lights are used without a diffuser, they must not be more than 20 mm apart.
T.3.4.4 If a single line of LEDs is used, the minimum length is 150 mm.
T.4 ELECTRONIC THROTTLE COMPONENTS
T.4.1 Applicability
This section T.4 applies only for:
• IC vehicles using Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) IC.4
• EV vehicles
T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
T.4.2.1 The Accelerator Pedal must actuate the APPS T.1.4.1
a. Two springs must be used to return the foot pedal to 0% Pedal Travel
b. Each spring must be capable of returning the pedal to 0% Pedal Travel with the other
disconnected. The springs in the APPS are not acceptable pedal return springs.
T.4.2.2 Two or more electrically separate sensors must be used as APPSs. A single OEM type APPS
with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.
T.4.2.3 The APPS sensors must have different transfer functions which meet one of the two:
• Each sensor has different gradients and/or offsets to the other(s). The circuit must have
a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 64 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.
T.4.2.8 The APPS signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a digital
data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay.
T.4.2.9 Any failure of the APPS or APPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be
treated like an Implausibility, see T.4.2.4 above
T.4.2.10 When an analogue signal is used, the APPS will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.2.11 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the APPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the APPS,
APPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.
T.4.2.12 The current rules are written to only apply to the APPS (pedal), but the integrity of the torque
command signal is important in all stages.
T.4.3 Brake System Encoder - BSE
T.4.3.1 The vehicle must have a sensor or switch to measure brake pedal position or brake system
pressure
T.4.3.2 The BSE must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
• A separate detachable connector(s) for any BSE signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 65 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
T.4.3.4 When an analogue signal is used, the BSE sensors will be considered to have failed when they
achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the
normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
T.4.3.5 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the BSE signal:
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures modes must include but are not limited to the failure of the sensor, sensor
signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
