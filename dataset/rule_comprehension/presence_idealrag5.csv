T.8.3 Positive Locking Mechanisms
T.8.3.1 Positive Locking Mechanisms are defined as those which:
a. Technical Inspectors / team members can see that the device/system is in place (visible).
b. Do not rely on the clamping force to apply the locking or anti vibration feature.
Meaning If the fastener begins to loosen, the locking device still prevents the fastener coming
completely loose

a. Correctly installed safety wiring
b. Cotter pins
c. Nylon lock nuts (where temperature does not exceed 80°C)
d. Prevailing torque lock nuts
Lock washers, bolts with nylon patches and thread locking compounds (Loctite®), DO NOT
meet the positive locking requirement.

required visibility throughout all dynamic events.
V.3 SUSPENSION AND STEERING
V.3.1 Suspension
V.3.1.1 The vehicle must have a fully operational suspension system with shock absorbers, front and
rear, with usable minimum wheel travel of 50 mm, with a driver seated.
V.3.1.2 Officials may disqualify vehicles which do not represent a serious attempt at an operational
suspension system, or which demonstrate handling inappropriate for an autocross circuit.
V.3.1.3 All suspension mounting points must be visible at Technical Inspection by direct view or by
removing any covers.
V.3.1.4 Fasteners in the Suspension system are Critical Fasteners, see T.8.2
V.3.1.5 All spherical rod ends and spherical bearings on the suspension and steering must be one of:
• Mounted in double shear
• Captured by having a screw/bolt head or washer with an outside diameter that is larger
than spherical bearing housing inside diameter.
V.3.2 Steering
V.3.2.1 The Steering Wheel must be mechanically connected to the front wheels
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 20 of 140

V.3.2.2 Electrically actuated steering of the front wheels is prohibited
V.3.2.3 Steering systems must use a rigid mechanical linkage capable of tension and compression
loads for operation
V.3.2.4 The steering system must have positive steering stops that prevent the steering linkages from
locking up (the inversion of a four bar linkage at one of the pivots). The stops:
a. Must prevent the wheels and tires from contacting suspension, bodywork, or Chassis
during the track events
b. May be placed on the uprights or on the rack
V.3.2.5 Allowable steering system free play is limited to seven degrees (7°) total measured at the
steering wheel.
V.3.2.6 The steering rack must be mechanically attached to the Chassis F.5.14
V.3.2.7 Joints between all components attaching the Steering Wheel to the steering rack must be
mechanical and be visible at Technical Inspection. Bonded joints without a mechanical backup
are not permitted.
V.3.2.8 Fasteners in the steering system are Critical Fasteners, see T.8.2
V.3.2.9 Spherical rod ends and spherical bearings in the steering must meet V.3.1.5 above
V.3.2.10 Rear wheel steering may be used.
a. Rear wheel steering must incorporate mechanical stops to limit the range of angular
movement of the rear wheels to a maximum of six degrees (6°).
b. The team must provide the ability for the steering angle range to be verified at Technical
Inspection with a driver in the vehicle.
c. Rear wheel steering may be electrically actuated.
V.3.3 Steering Wheel
V.3.3.1 In any angular position, the Steering Wheel must meet T.1.4.4
V.3.3.2 The Steering Wheel must be attached to the column with a quick disconnect.
V.3.3.3 The driver must be able to operate the quick disconnect while in the normal driving position
with gloves on.
V.3.3.4 The Steering Wheel must have a continuous perimeter that is near circular or near oval.
The outer perimeter profile may have some straight sections, but no concave sections. “H”,
“Figure 8”, or cutout wheels are not allowed.
V.4 WHEELS AND TIRES
V.4.1 Wheel Size
Wheels must be 203.2 mm (8.0 inches) or more in diameter.
V.4.2 Wheel Attachment
V.4.2.1 Any wheel mounting system that uses a single retaining nut must incorporate a device to
retain the nut and the wheel if the nut loosens.
A second nut (jam nut) does not meet this requirement
V.4.2.2 Teams using modified lug bolts or custom designs must provide proof that Good Engineering
Practices have been followed in their design.
V.4.2
pension
V.3.1.1 The vehicle must have a fully operational suspension system with shock absorbers, front and
rear, with usable minimum wheel travel of 50 mm, with a driver seated.

suspension system, or which demonstrate handling inappropriate for an autocross circuit.
V.3.1.3 All suspension mounting points must be visible at Technical Inspection by direct view or by
removing any covers.

Also attached is an image showing seven CAD views (each boxed in black) of our vehicle design. The top, big view shows a close-up view of the design. The six smaller views on the bottom of the image show different complete views of the CAD of the vehicle and are provided for context. Note that the close-up view orientation matches one of the six complete view orientations. The close-up view may also have some components hidden (with respect to the corresponding complete view) for visualization of specific components. Looking at the close-up view, is/are any part of the the firewall visible in the close-up view? Answer simply with yes or no."
