retain the nut and the wheel if the nut loosens.
A second nut (jam nut) does not meet this requirement
V.4.2.2 Teams using modified lug bolts or custom designs must provide proof that Good Engineering
Practices have been followed in their design.

IC.4 ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL
This section IC.4 applies only when Electronic Throttle Control is used
An Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) system may be used. This is a device or system which
may change the engine throttle setting based on various inputs.
IC.4.1 General Design
IC.4.1.1 The electronic throttle must automatically close (return to idle) when power is removed.
IC.4.1.2 The electronic throttle must use minimum two sources of energy capable of returning the
throttle to the idle position.
a. One of the sources may be the device (such as a DC motor) that normally actuates the
throttle
b. The other device(s) must be a throttle return spring that can return the throttle to the
idle position if loss of actuator power occurs.
c. Springs in the TPS are not acceptable throttle return springs
IC.4.1.3 The ETC system may blip the throttle during downshifts when proven that unintended
acceleration can be avoided. The functional analysis must be documented in the ETC Systems

Also attached is an image showing seven CAD views (each boxed in black) of our vehicle design. The top, big view shows a close-up view of the design. The six smaller views on the bottom of the image show different complete views of the CAD of the vehicle and are provided for context. Note that the close-up view orientation matches one of the six complete view orientations. The close-up view may also have some components hidden (with respect to the corresponding complete view) for visualization of specific components. Looking at the close-up view, is/are any part of the the firewall visible in the close-up view? Answer simply with yes or no."
