IC.3.1.1 The vehicle must have a carburetor or throttle body.
a. The carburetor or throttle body may be of any size or design.
b. Boosted applications must not use carburetors.
IC.3.2 Throttle Actuation Method
The throttle may be actuated:
a. Mechanically by a cable or rod system IC.3.3
b. By Electronic Throttle Control IC.4
IC.3.3 Throttle Actuation – Mechanical
IC.3.3.1 The throttle cable or rod must:
a. Have smooth operation
b. Have no possibility of binding or sticking
c. Be minimum 50 mm from any exhaust system component and out of the exhaust stream
d. Be protected from being bent or kinked by the driver’s foot when it is operated by the
driver or when the driver enters or exits the vehicle
IC.3.3.2 The throttle actuation system must use two or more return springs located at the throttle
body.
Throttle Position Sensors (TPS) are NOT acceptable as return springs
IC.3.3.3 Failure of any component of the throttle system must not prevent the throttle returning to
the closed position.
IC.4 ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL
This section IC.4 applies only when Electronic Throttle Control is used
An Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) system may be used. This is a device or system which
may change the engine throttle setting based on various inputs.
IC.4.1 General Design
IC.4.1.1 The electronic throttle must automatically close (return to idle) when power is removed.
IC.4.1.2 The electronic throttle must use minimum two sources of energy capable of returning the
throttle to the idle position.
a. One of the sources may be the device (such as a DC motor) that normally actuates the
throttle
b. The other device(s) must be a throttle return spring that can return the throttle to the
idle position if loss of actuator power occurs.
c. Springs in the TPS are not acceptable throttle return springs
IC.4.1.3 The ETC system may blip the throttle during downshifts when proven that unintended
acceleration can be avoided. The functional analysis must be documented in the ETC Systems
Form

Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
IC.4.2 Commercial ETC System
IC.4.2.1 An ETC system that is commercially available, but does not comply with the regulations, may
be used, if approved prior to the event.
IC.4.2.2 To obtain approval, submit a Rules Question which includes:
• Which ETC system the team is seeking approval to use.
• The specific ETC rule(s) that the commercial system deviates from.
• Sufficient technical details of these deviations to determine the acceptability of the
commercial system.
IC.4.3 Documentation
IC.4.3.1 The ETC Notice of Intent:
• Must be submitted to inform the organizer of the intent to run ETC
• May be used to screen which teams are allowed to use ETC
IC.4.3.2 The ETC Systems Form must be submitted in order to use ETC
IC.4.3.3 Submit the ETC Notice of Intent and ETC Systems Form as given in section DR - Document
Requirements
IC.4.3.4 Late or non submission will prevent use of ETC, see DR.3.4.1
IC.4.4 Throttle Position Sensor - TPS
IC.4.4.1 The TPS must measure the position of the throttle or the throttle actuator.
Throttle position is defined as percent of travel from fully closed to wide open where 0% is
fully closed and 100% is fully open.
IC.4.4.2 Two or more separate sensors must be used as TPSs. The TPSs may share the same supply and
reference lines only if effects of supply and/or reference line voltage offsets can be detected.
IC.4.4.3 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% throttle position between the
sensors or other failure as defined in Section IC.4. Use of values larger than 10% may be
considered on a case by case basis and require justification in the ETC Systems Form
IC.4.4.4 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the two TPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the electronic throttle must be immediately shut down.
IC.4.4.5 If three sensors are used, then in the case of a TPS failure, any two TPSs that agree within 10%
throttle position may be used to define the throttle position target and the 3rd TPS may be
ignored.
IC.4.4.6 Each TPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of:
a. A separate detachable connector(s) for any TPS signal(s) to the main ECU without
affecting any other connections
b. An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each TPS
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
IC.4.4.7 The TPS signals must be sent directly to the throttle controller using an analogue signal or via
a digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay. Any failure of the TPSs or TPS wiring
must be detectable by the controller and must be treated like Implausibility.
IC.4.4.8 When an analogue signal is used, the TPSs will be considered to have failed when they achieve
an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the normal
operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 V.
Formula SAE® Rules 2024 © 2023 SAE International Page 81 of 140
Version 1.0 1 Sep 2023
The circuitry used to evaluate the sensor must use pull down or pull up resistors to ensure
that open circuit signals result in a failure being detected.
IC.4.4.9 When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the TPS signal,
a. The ETC Systems Form must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure
modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that
have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.
b. The failures to be considered must include but are not limited to the failure of the TPS,
TPS signals being out of range, corruption of the message and loss of messages and the
associated time outs.

a. The power to the electronic throttle must be shut down if the mechanical brakes are
actuated and the TPS signals that the throttle is open by more than a permitted amount
for more than one second.
b. An interval of one second is allowed for the throttle to close (return to idle). Failure to
achieve this in the required interval must result in immediate shut down of fuel flow and
the ignition system.
c. The permitted relationship between BSE and TPS may be defined by the team using a
table. This functionality must be demonstrated at Technical Inspection.
IC.4.7.2 Throttle Position vs Target
a. The power to the electronic throttle must be immediately shut down, if throttle position
differs by more than 10% from the expected target TPS position for more than one
second.
b. An interval of one second is allowed for the difference to reduce to less than 10%, failure
to achieve this in the required interval must result in immediate shut down of fuel flow
and the ignition system.
c. An error in TPS position and the resultant system shutdown must be demonstrated at
Technical Inspection.
Teams must have a method to demonstrate that the actions in IC.4.7.2.b above are met.
System states displayed using calibration software must be accompanied by a detailed
explanation of the control system.
IC.4.7.3 The electronic throttle and fuel injector/ignition system shutdown must stay active until the
TPS signals indicate the throttle is at or below the unpowered default position for one second
or longer.
IC.4.8 Brake System Plausibility Device - BSPD

control.
The BSPD must be provided in addition to the Throttle Plausibility Checks IC.4.7
