GR - GENERAL REGULATIONS
GR.1 FORMULA SAE COMPETITION OBJECTIVE
GR.1.1 Collegiate Design Series
SAE International's Collegiate Design Series (CDS) programs prepare undergraduate and
graduate engineering students in a variety of disciplines for future employment in mobility-
related industries by challenging them with a real world, engineering application.
Through the Engineering Design Process, experiences may include but are not limited to:
• Project management, budgeting, communication, and resource management skills
• Team collaboration
• Applying industry rules and regulations
• Design, build, and test the performance of a real vehicle
• Interact and compete with other students from around the globe
• Develop and prepare technical documentation
Students also gain valuable exposure to and engagement with industry professionals to
enhance 21st century learning skills, to build their own network and help prepare them for the
workforce after graduation.
GR.1.2 Formula SAE Concept
The Formula SAE® competitions challenge teams of university undergraduate and graduate
students to conceive, design, fabricate, develop and compete with small, formula style
vehicles.
GR.1.3 Engineering Competition
Formula SAE® is an engineering education competition that requires performance
demonstration of vehicles in a series of events, both off track and on track against the clock.
Each competition gives teams the chance to demonstrate their creativity and engineering
skills in comparison to teams from other universities around the world.
GR.1.4 Vehicle Design Objectives
GR.1.4.1 Teams are to assume that they work for an engineering firm that is designing, fabricating,
testing and demonstrating a prototype vehicle.
GR.1.4.2 The vehicle should have high performance and be sufficiently durable to successfully complete
all the events at the Formula SAE competitions.
GR.1.4.3 Additional design factors include: aesthetics, cost, ergonomics, maintainability, and
manufacturability.
GR.1.4.4 Each design will be judged and evaluated against other competing designs in a series of Static
and Dynamic events to determine the vehicle that best meets the design goals and may be
profitably built and marketed.
GR.1.5 Good Engineering Practices
Vehicles entered into Formula SAE competitions should be designed and fabricated in
accordance with good engineering practices.
