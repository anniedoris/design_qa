Open Wheel vehicles must satisfy all of the following criteria:
a. The top 180° of the wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from vertically
above the wheel.
b. The wheels/tires must be unobstructed when viewed from the side.
c. No part of the vehicle may enter a keep out zone defined by two lines extending
vertically from positions 75 mm in front of and 75 mm aft of, the outer diameter of the
front and rear tires in the side view elevation of the vehicle, with tires steered straight
ahead. This keep out zone will extend laterally from the outside plane of the wheel/tire
to the inboard plane of the wheel/tire.
V.1.2 Wheelbase
The vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm
V.1.3 Vehicle Track
V.1.3.1 The track and center of gravity must combine to provide sufficient rollover stability. See

b. When seated in a normal driving position, the driver must have a minimum field of vision
of 100° to both sides
c. If mirrors are required for this rule, they must remain in place and adjusted to enable the
required visibility throughout all dynamic events.
V.3 SUSPENSION AND STEERING
V.3.1 Suspension
V.3.1.1 The vehicle must have a fully operational suspension system with shock absorbers, front and
rear, with usable minimum wheel travel of 50 mm, with a driver seated.
V.3.1.2 Officials may disqualify vehicles which do not represent a serious attempt at an operational
suspension system, or which demonstrate handling inappropriate for an autocross circuit.
V.3.1.3 All suspension mounting points must be visible at Technical Inspection by direct view or by
removing any covers.
V.3.1.4 Fasteners in the Suspension system are Critical Fasteners, see T.8.2

T.3.3.5 The driver must not be able to reset the BOTS.
T.3.3.6 The BOTS must be implemented with analog components, and not using programmable logic
controllers, engine control units, or similar functioning digital controllers.
T.3.4 Brake Light
T.3.4.1 The vehicle must have a Brake Light that is clearly visible from the rear in very bright sunlight.
T.3.4.2 The Brake Light must be:
a. Red in color on a Black background
b. Rectangular, triangular or near round shape with a minimum shining surface of 15 cm2
c. Mounted between the wheel centerline and driver’s shoulder level vertically and
approximately on vehicle centerline laterally.
T.3.4.3 When LED lights are used without a diffuser, they must not be more than 20 mm apart.
T.3.4.4 If a single line of LEDs is used, the minimum length is 150 mm.
T.4 ELECTRONIC THROTTLE COMPONENTS
T.4.1 Applicability
This section T.4 applies only for:
• IC vehicles using Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) IC.4
• EV vehicles
T.4.2 Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor - APPS
T.4.2.1 The Accelerator Pedal must actuate the APPS T.1.4.1
a. Two springs must be used to return the foot pedal to 0% Pedal Travel
b. Each spring must be capable of returning the pedal to 0% Pedal Travel with the other
disconnected. The springs in the APPS are not acceptable pedal return springs.
T.4.2.2 Two or more electrically separate sensors must be used as APPSs. A single OEM type APPS
with two completely separate sensors in a single housing is acceptable.
T.4.2.3 The APPS sensors must have different transfer functions which meet one of the two:
• Each sensor has different gradients and/or offsets to the other(s). The circuit must have
a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
completely.

(EV only) It is not necessary to Open the Shutdown Circuit, the motor controller(s) stopping
the power to the Motor(s) is sufficient.
T.4.2.6 If three sensors are used, then in the case of an APPS failure, any two sensors that agree
within 10% Pedal Travel may be used to define the (IC) throttle position / (EV) torque target
and the 3rd APPS may be ignored.
T.4.2.7 Each APPS must be able to be checked during Technical Inspection by having one of the two:
• A separate detachable connector that enables a check of functions by unplugging it
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each APPS
signal.

affecting any other connections
• An inline switchable breakout box available that allows disconnection of each BSE
signal(s) to the main ECU without affecting any other connections
T.4.3.3 The BSE or switch signals must be sent directly to a controller using an analogue signal or via a
digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay
Any failure of the BSE or BSE wiring that persists more than 100 msec must be detectable by
the controller and treated like an implausibility and power to the (IC) electronic throttle / (EV)
Motor(s) must be immediately stopped completely.
(EV only) It is not necessary to completely deactivate the Tractive System, the motor
controller(s) stopping power to the motor(s) is sufficient.

a pull-up or pull-down resistor to bring an open circuit input to 0% Pedal Travel
• An OEM pedal sensor with opposite slopes. Non OEM opposite slope sensor
configurations require prior approval.
The intent is that in a short circuit the APPSs will only agree at 0% Pedal Travel
T.4.2.4 Implausibility is defined as a deviation of more than 10% Pedal Travel between the sensors or
other failure as defined in this Section T.4.2. Use of values larger than 10% Pedal Travel
require justification in the ETC Systems Form and may not be approved
T.4.2.5 If an Implausibility occurs between the values of the APPSs and persists for more than 100
msec, the power to the (IC) Electronic Throttle / (EV) Motor(s) must be immediately stopped
