T.8.2.4_yes,T.8.2.4,yes,direct,left,rear wheel package,3,11,The fastener shown in the section view in the engineering drawing is the critical fastener. It has 1 thread/mm.,"In the CAD views, the fastner highlighted in pink is the critical fastener.",The rules require a minimum of 3 threads showing for critical fasteners. Since there is 1 thread per millimeter and we have a extended bolt length of over 3mm we are rules compliant.
